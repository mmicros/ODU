The 100-game mark seems mainly about symbolism, as the Huskies have already had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2010/12/its-over-after-surpassing-1970s-mens.html&quot;&gt;90-game&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;winning streak (snapped in 2010) and a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.villanova.com/sports/w-baskbl/recaps/031103aaa.html&quot;&gt;70-game&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;victory stretch (ended in 2003). The John Wooden-coached UCLA men&#39;s basketball program pulled off an 88-game winning streak, which ended in 1974.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following chart shows UConn&#39;s margin of victory in its last 99 games (arranged chronologically from left to right). Exact margins are shown up to 40 points, but if the Huskies won by more than 40, there&#39;s just a &quot;&amp;gt;40&quot; box on top. You can click on the graphic to enlarge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;UConn &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_East_Conference_(1979%E2%80%932013)&quot;&gt;used to be in the Big East&lt;/a&gt;, along with, at various times, such top women&#39;s hoop programs as Villanova, Notre Dame, and Louisville. However, after the big &lt;a href=&quot;http://conferencerealignment.blogspot.com/2013/04/resolution-of-big-east-break-up-into.html&quot;&gt;conference-realignment shake-out&lt;/a&gt; of the 2010s, the Huskies ended up in the American Athletic Conference (AAC), which at the moment doesn&#39;t have any real competitors for UConn.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;UConn Margin of Victory in Last 99 Games&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1iUyPmjVKGw/WKH9FzeXDGI/AAAAAAAADpY/3EbafIhogZw2DsUUeT49gTPN4KC3WxEFwCLcB/s1600/uconn%2Bcloses%2Bin%2Bon%2B100.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1iUyPmjVKGw/WKH9FzeXDGI/AAAAAAAADpY/3EbafIhogZw2DsUUeT49gTPN4KC3WxEFwCLcB/s400/uconn%2Bcloses%2Bin%2Bon%2B100.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As seen in the light-blue columns above, UConn has won every AAC game (regular-season and conference-tournament), except two, by 20 or more points (games 51 and 31&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/womens-college-basketball/story/_/id/18452652/examining-every-victory-connecticut-huskies-ncaa-record-winning-streak&quot;&gt; in this list&lt;/a&gt;). The Huskies have won nearly 40 AAC games by 40 or more points. (Game 86, vs. Nebraska, has a typo; it should be 84-41.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The royal-blue columns represent nonconference games (both in the regular season and in the NCAA tournament). To UConn&#39;s credit, it schedules many games against elite nonconference opposition, including Tennessee (&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connecticut%E2%80%93Tennessee_rivalry&quot;&gt;until 2007&lt;/a&gt;), Notre Dame, Duke, Baylor, Maryland, Florida State, and tonight&#39;s opponent, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courant.com/sports/uconn-womens-basketball/hc-uconn-women-basketball-0213-20170212-story.html&quot;&gt;South Carolina&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(curently ranked No. 6 in the nation). As can be seen, the heights of the royal-blue bars are much lower than the light-blue ones. In fact, twice this season UConn won by two and six points, against &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.courant.com/sports/uconn-womens-basketball/hc-uconn-women-basketball-1115-20161114-story.html&quot;&gt;Florida State&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-women/article/2016-12-29/uconn-maryland-recap-no-1-huskies-win-87th-straight-against&quot;&gt;Maryland&lt;/a&gt;, respectively.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The early 1970s UCLA men had a lot more close calls during its 88-game winning streak. According to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dailynews.com/article/ZZ/20101219/NEWS/101218311&quot;&gt;retrospective article&lt;/a&gt;, “Two games were one-point victories. Three more were by two points.” Another 11 wins by 4-9 points. Of course, the college game had neither a shot-clock nor a three-point shot at that time, Teams could hold the ball on UCLA and the lack of a three would have kept the scoring down.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;direction: ltr; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 0in; margin-top: 0pt; unicode-bidi: embed; word-break: normal;&quot;&gt;I would think UConn would be a heavy favorite tonight, but if there&#39;s any chance for the game to be competitive, having a strong nonconference opponent makes it more likely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;*The information on the UCLA men&#39;s streak was added later.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/1285119284065085349/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=1285119284065085349&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/1285119284065085349'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/1285119284065085349'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2017/02/the-university-of-connecticut-womens.html' title='UConn Women Go for 100 Straight Wins'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-1iUyPmjVKGw/WKH9FzeXDGI/AAAAAAAADpY/3EbafIhogZw2DsUUeT49gTPN4KC3WxEFwCLcB/s72-c/uconn%2Bcloses%2Bin%2Bon%2B100.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-2843721061462854826</id><published>2017-01-05T14:37:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2017-01-05T21:17:16.847-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Columbus Blue Jackets Seek to Tie NHL Record for Longest Winning Streak</title><content type='html'>Tonight, in the nation&#39;s capital, the Columbus Blue Jackets will &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/columbus-blue-jackets-tie-nhl-record-17th-win-44557007&quot;&gt;try to tie the NHL record&lt;/a&gt; of 17 straight wins, held by the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportsnet.ca/hockey/nhl/columbus-closing-history-look-longest-nhl-winning-streaks/&quot;&gt;1992-93 Pittsburgh Penguins&lt;/a&gt;.

Many articles have appeared on the Blue Jackets&#39; streak, from analytic (&lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/news/in-praise-of-the-columbus-blue-jackets-what-we-learned-150821667.html&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesportsdaily.com/buckeye-state-hockey/on-the-blue-jackets-streak-and-unsustainability/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jacketscannon.com/2016/12/17/13990762/the-blue-jackets-are-good-not-lucky-or-doomed-metropolitan-playoffs-statistics-rebuttal&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), and even &lt;a href=&quot;https://hockey-graphs.com/2016/12/27/how-good-is-columbus-a-bayesian-approach/#more-14342&quot;&gt;Bayesian statistical&lt;/a&gt; perspectives. I was interviewed in this &lt;i&gt;SB Nation&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbnation.com/nhl/2017/1/1/14137708/columbus-blue-jackets-win-streak-nhl-record-minnesota-wild-calvert-dumba-stewart-anderson-fight&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two main issues stand out to me. One, which the &lt;i&gt;SB Nation&lt;/i&gt; writer discussed with me but didn&#39;t make it into the article, is the likelihood of a team with the Blue Jackets&#39;, shall we say, non-illustrious history going on such a long winning streak. As I wrote in my book &lt;i&gt;Hot Hand&lt;/i&gt;, &quot;many of the most famous streaks... have been compiled by athletes and teams who are among the all-time greats in their respective sports&quot; (p. 5). Examples cited include Kobe Bryant, Joe DiMaggio, and Tiger Woods. As the late Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/1988/08/18/the-streak-of-streaks/&quot;&gt;once wrote&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Long streaks always are, and must be, a matter of extraordinary luck imposed upon great skill.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Blue Jackets hardly seem to be the kind of winning franchise, upon which only a little luck would have to be added to produce a long string of victories. Columbus has made only &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/CBJ/&quot;&gt;two playoff appearances in the 16 years&lt;/a&gt; of franchise history, most recently in 2013-14. At the risk of overstatement, a Blue Jackets&#39; winning streak would be like hearing that a run of 50 consecutive made free throws belonged to Shaq O&#39;Neal rather than Steph Curry.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second issue, pertaining to on-the-rink statistics, involves shots on goal. Because goals are rare in hockey, analysts typically focus instead on teams&#39; shot-on-goal totals, which turn out to be a good measure of puck possession (see the new book &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hockey-Abstract-Presents-Stat-Shot/dp/177041309X/&quot;&gt;Stat Shot: The Ultimate Guide to Hockey Analytics&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, by Rob Vollman and colleagues, for further discussion).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As shown &lt;a href=&quot;http://thesportsdaily.com/buckeye-state-hockey/on-the-blue-jackets-streak-and-unsustainability/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, in games before the streak, Columbus and its opponents were each taking roughly 50% of the shots (see the columns marked Corsi, Fenwick, and Shots For). During the streak, in contrast, the Blue Jackets have around 54% of the shots in their games and their opponents, 46%. Aggregate shot totals can be misleading, however, because of &lt;i&gt;score effects&lt;/i&gt;, the phenomenon of a trailing team bombarding the opposing net with desperation shots in an attempt to get back in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I created the following graphic to take game context into account. Using a puck image for each game during the Columbus winning streak, I plotted the Blue Jackets&#39; deficit or lead on the scoreboard on the &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;-axis (from losing by 2 to winning by 4). On the&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt;-axis, we see differences between the Blue Jackets&#39; and opponents&#39; actual numbers of third-period shots (which may be more intuitive to grasp&amp;nbsp;than the percentage of total shots attributable to each team). The puck in the upper-left corner of the graph, for example, represents the Blue Jackets&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/nhl/recap/_/gameId/400884764&quot;&gt;December 3 game at Arizona&lt;/a&gt;, the third game in Columbus&#39;s streak. The Jackets trailed 2-1 after two periods (the only game during the streak in which they entered the third period trailing), but in a feverish attempt to tie the game (which Columbus did with 2:16 remaining), outshot the Coyotes 23-4 in the third (+19). Columbus eventually won 3-2 via shootout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If a game is close (i.e., tied or within one goal either way) heading into the third period, we should find Columbus dominating the shots-on-goal totals in the third period during the winning streak. If the Blue Jackets are relatively comfortably ahead, on the other hand, we would expect their opponents to be dominating the shots. This is exactly what we find.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bgitahjMAkg/WG6XoZRn-ZI/AAAAAAAADn0/aEFKKGhjRUgN8Rl-ca02J1_oDXwCC1HswCLcB/s1600/blue%2Bjackets%2Bshots%2Bon%2Bgoal.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;400&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bgitahjMAkg/WG6XoZRn-ZI/AAAAAAAADn0/aEFKKGhjRUgN8Rl-ca02J1_oDXwCC1HswCLcB/s400/blue%2Bjackets%2Bshots%2Bon%2Bgoal.jpg&quot; width=&quot;388&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For those with some statistical training, the correlation between size of Columbus&#39;s lead on the scoreboard (with a deficit scored with a negative sign) and their edge or deficit in third-period shots was a statistically significant (&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = -.58; see blade of the hockey stick in the graphic). The less favorable the Blue Jackets&#39; situation after two periods (trailing or tied), the more they outshot their opponents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, if you&#39;re a Blue Jackets fan or simply like to see long streaks, don&#39;t worry if Columbus is not leading after the second period. In that event, a Blue Jacket barrage on the Capitals&#39; net seems almost certain!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; It was not to be for the Blue Jackets, as the Washington Capitals &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/nhl/recap?gameId=400884975&quot;&gt;routed them 5-0&lt;/a&gt;, ending Columbus&#39;s winning streak at 16 games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;*That&#39;s not to say that amazing turnarounds don&#39;t occur. Baseball&#39;s Atlanta Braves went from a 65-97 record in 1990 to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/ATL/&quot;&gt;14 straight divisional titles&lt;/a&gt; (excluding the incomplete, strike-shortened 1994 season). Also, football&#39;s San Francisco 49ers went &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/sfo/&quot;&gt;2-14 and 6-10 under Bill Walsh&lt;/a&gt; in 1979 and 1980, respectively, before winning the Super Bowl after the 1981 season. The team would win three more Super Bowls in the decade.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/2843721061462854826/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=2843721061462854826&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2843721061462854826'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2843721061462854826'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2017/01/columbus-blue-jackets-seek-to-tie-nhl.html' title='Columbus Blue Jackets Seek to Tie NHL Record for Longest Winning Streak'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-bgitahjMAkg/WG6XoZRn-ZI/AAAAAAAADn0/aEFKKGhjRUgN8Rl-ca02J1_oDXwCC1HswCLcB/s72-c/blue%2Bjackets%2Bshots%2Bon%2Bgoal.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-4652722512041415463</id><published>2016-11-24T13:56:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2016-11-24T13:56:51.827-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Gotta &quot;Love&quot; It -- 34 Points, 8-of-10 on Treys, in First Quarter Alone</title><content type='html'>As most NBA fans have probably heard by now, the Cleveland Cavaliers&#39; Kevin Love scored &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/18125127&quot;&gt;34 points in the first quarter&lt;/a&gt; last night in leading his team to a 137-125 victory over visiting Portland. It was a record for most points in the &lt;i&gt;first&lt;/i&gt; quarter, but not for any quarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Golden State&#39;s Klay Thompson once scored 37 points in the third quarter of a game. Although Love&#39;s single-quarter point total last night (34) approached Thompson&#39;s record, Thompson&#39;s is truly one of a kind, in my view, for another reason. Whereas Love missed a few shots last night in the first quarter, going 3-of-4 on two-point attempts, 8-of-10 on shots from behind the arc, and 4-of-4 on free-throws, Thompson&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2015/01/greatest-shooting-quarter-in-nba.html&quot;&gt;didn&#39;t miss a single shot&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of any kind in his big quarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love&#39;s 8-of-10 performance on first-quarter threes is nothing to sneeze at, however, and it is the aspect of his record night that I&#39;d like to focus on. Love is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/3449/kevin-love&quot;&gt;career .363 three-point shooter&lt;/a&gt; in a little over eight years in the NBA and his season-specific three-point shooting-percentages have been very consistent in recent years (.376 in 2013-14; .367 in 2014-15; .360 in 2015-16). Thus far in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.espn.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/3449/kevin-love&quot;&gt;current season&lt;/a&gt;, before last night&#39;s game, Love was hitting on .316 (18-of-57) of his treys.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using Love&#39;s career .363 baseline success-rate, we can ask what is the probability that he would make 8 (or more) three-pointers in a 10-attempt sequence. Using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://vassarstats.net/binomialX.html&quot;&gt;binomial calculator&lt;/a&gt;, the answer is .006 or 6-in-1,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In one sense, Love&#39;s scoring outburst might be considered more impressive than Thompson&#39;s. Compared to Thompson&#39;s .417 career NBA three-point shooting-percentage (and .444 for the season coming into his record-setting game), Love&#39;s career and season-to-date baseline success-rates were several percentage-points lower. It is, of course, harder for someone with a lower baseline success-rate to enter a stretch of hitting at a torrid pace.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Love scored only 6 more points after the first quarter last night, finishing with 40. Cleveland led comfortably for most of the game, entering the fourth quarter up 112-92, so was able to rest its starters.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/4652722512041415463/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=4652722512041415463&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4652722512041415463'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4652722512041415463'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2016/11/gotta-love-it-34-points-8-of-10-on.html' title='Gotta &quot;Love&quot; It -- 34 Points, 8-of-10 on Treys, in First Quarter Alone'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-881460427773039372</id><published>2016-08-04T19:05:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2016-08-04T19:12:27.397-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Michael Phelps Looks to Extend Olympic-Gold Streaks</title><content type='html'>With the opening ceremonies for the 2016 Rio de Janeiro Olympics getting underway tomorrow, swimming enthusiasts are anticipating whether -- and to what degree -- Michael Phelps will be able to extend his career-total medal haul. He currently owns 22 Olympic medals, 18 gold, 2 silver, and 2 bronze.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In terms of Olympic streaks, Phelps has ongoing runs of three straight golds in the 100-meter butterfly and the 200-meter individual medley. He will attempt to extend each of these streaks to four in a row. Before Phelps won the two aforementioned events in 2012, &lt;a href=&quot;https://swimswam.com/michael-phelps-becomes-first-to-win-three-straight-titles/&quot;&gt;no male swimmer had won the same event&lt;/a&gt; at more than two straight Olympiad. &amp;nbsp;He will swim a third individual event in Rio, namely the 200 butterfly, in which he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-oly-swim-swm2bu-idUSBRE86U1CZ20120731&quot;&gt;narrowly missed&lt;/a&gt; a third straight gold in 2012.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following chart (which you can click to enlarge) shows Phelps&#39;s medal performances not just at the past three Olympiad, but also at the World Championships and Pan-Pacific Championships. The chart includes only the three individual events he will swim in Rio. Phelps did not compete in 2013 due to his brief retirement, plus USA Swimming &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/early-lead/wp/2014/10/06/michael-phelps-banned-for-6-months-and-2015-fina-world-championships-by-usa-swimming/&quot;&gt;kept him off the team&lt;/a&gt; for the 2015 Worlds for his drunk-driving offenses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rf1x83bq-8U/V6PeAf5nBiI/AAAAAAAADjA/ZweikW_9JCMaCT8dg-dbjuMg72LGg4zdgCLcB/s1600/phelps%2Bheading%2Binto%2B2016%2BOG.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;140&quot; src=&quot;https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rf1x83bq-8U/V6PeAf5nBiI/AAAAAAAADjA/ZweikW_9JCMaCT8dg-dbjuMg72LGg4zdgCLcB/s400/phelps%2Bheading%2Binto%2B2016%2BOG.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s pre-Olympic issue picks Phelps to win one gold -- in the 100-meter butterfly, just ahead of Hungary&#39;s Laszlo Cseh. Within 2016, Cseh (50.86) has actually swum this race faster than Phelps (51.00), but we don&#39;t know that all circumstances (e.g., amount of rest; pool conditions) were comparable.

Or perhaps it’s the reputations of current team executive Theo Epstein and manager Joe Maddon. Whatever the reason, the team’s fast start this season inspired no shortage of superlatives from the media.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On May 15, with the Cubs sitting at 27-9, CBS Sports.com &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbssports.com/mlb/news/14-things-to-know-about-the-chicago-cubs-hot-and-historical-start-to-the-season/&quot;&gt;splashed around words&lt;/a&gt; such as “historic,” “remarkable,” and “incredible” in describing the team’s start.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On June 7, with the Cubs having advanced their record to 40-16 the night before, FiveThirtyEight made the &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-years-cubs-might-be-better-than-the-incredible-27-yankees/&quot;&gt;stunning comparison&lt;/a&gt; of Maddon’s bunch to the 1927 Yankees.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, as the season resumes Friday after the All-Star Break, the Northsiders are 53-35. The team’s record has been 26-26 since the CBS Sports article and 13-19 since FiveThirtyEight’s piece.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Cubs’ slide began on June 20, the opening day of a three-game Wrigley Field series with St. Louis, which the Cardinals swept. Chicago has now lost five of its last six series (plus a one-game make-up game with Atlanta). Using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/schedule/_/name/chc&quot;&gt;Cubs’ game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;, I plotted the results of all of their series so far this season, in chronological order. Opponents are shown on the horizontal axis and the outcome of each series is shown on the vertical axis (sweeping a three-game series would be +3, getting swept four would be -4, etc.; see legend below the graph). You may click on the graphics to enlarge them.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jdz-QDVlrz8/V4iPlG1kwBI/AAAAAAAADhs/oJYg7HhNDu0s7KxYkvBHx1brTFMLCb9RgCLcB/s1600/cubs%2B1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;286&quot; src=&quot;https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jdz-QDVlrz8/V4iPlG1kwBI/AAAAAAAADhs/oJYg7HhNDu0s7KxYkvBHx1brTFMLCb9RgCLcB/s400/cubs%2B1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Legend: On the vertical axis, +4, +3, -3, and -4 represent sweeps of 4- or 3-game series; +2 or -2 can result from sweeps of 2-game series or winning or losing 3 in a 4-game series; 0 = split of 2- or 4-game series. The number of games in a series is shown in parentheses after the opponent’s name on the horizontal axis. Asterisk (*) indicates series with 1-game rain postponement until later in season.]&lt;/i&gt;  ___________________________________________________________________________&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Presumably, the Cubs have declined in one or more of the following areas: hitting, pitching, and defense. Hitting does not seem to be the major problem. The team’s two leaders in OPS (On-base Plus Slugging percentages), Anthony Rizzo and Kris Bryant, have maintained a torrid pace. In fact, Rizzo’s two best monthly OPS figures have come in June (1.211) and July (1.178). The same is true for Bryant (June, 1.058; July, 1.222). Addison Russell and Jason Heyward have been steady, if unspectacular, with monthly OPS values in the .700-.800 range of late. That’s not to say that nobody has slumped. Dexter Fowler’s OPS in April, May, and June fell respectively from 1.087 to .879 to .605, and Ben Zobrist has fallen to an OPS of .707 in June and .640 in July, after he had attained a 1.136 in May. Still, there is no universal collapse in hitting among the Cubs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To evaluate starting pitchers’ individual outings, I use the “game score” statistic developed by Bill James. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_score&quot;&gt;scoring system&lt;/a&gt; starts a pitcher out with 50 points, then adds points for good pitcher outcomes (e.g., 1 point for each out, plus an additional point for a strikeout) and subtracts points for bad outcomes (-2 for each hit allowed, -4 for each earned-run yielded). Game scores for each and every start by a given pitcher are included among ESPN.com’s pitching statistics. I have plotted game scores for each of the Cubs’ five regular starters, shown in chronological order.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UpcGpG6A5-8/V4iPlP0DjxI/AAAAAAAADhw/2TYmgTAwAaIzwAMtbTp2Zj_9AMMRMWwIwCEw/s1600/cubs%2B2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;276&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-UpcGpG6A5-8/V4iPlP0DjxI/AAAAAAAADhw/2TYmgTAwAaIzwAMtbTp2Zj_9AMMRMWwIwCEw/s400/cubs%2B2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although the data are noisy, the general trend is that Cubs starters – four of whom are age 30 and older – began declining around their 15th starts. Before that, most outings were in the 50-80 range (highlighted in gray), meaning that pitchers made a net gain in points above the 50 with which they automatically started.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;John Lackey recorded a 23 in his 15th start (a 9-6 Cubs loss at Miami), Jason Hammel struggled badly with a 5 in his 16th start (a 10-2 loss at the Mets), and Jon Lester also registered a 5; this came in his 17th start, another blow-out loss (14-3) at Citi Field. Jake Arrieta, though not hitting the low points of some of his teammates, has thrown clearly subpar games in his last three starts (game scores of 38, 38, and 35). Kyle Hendricks has been the even-keel starter, never deviating from a range of 41-80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to another &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-cubs-pitchers-are-making-their-own-luck/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight article&lt;/a&gt;, as of June 19 (right before the Cubs’ spate of losing series), Chicago pitchers appeared to be benefiting from two developments: their “contact-management skills” or “tendency to allow batted balls that do less damage;” and excellent defensive play from the fielders. Getting into the physics of batted balls, “Cubs pitchers [had] depressed exit velocity by 0.4 miles per hour and launch angle by almost 2 degrees, relative to average.” In terms of fielding, free-agent acquisition Heyward has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/news/all-star-game-defensive-josh-donaldson-salvador-perez-paul-goldschmidt-nolan-arenado/1twus5evmnrsy1kn9ln5kj310o&quot;&gt;saved 35 runs&lt;/a&gt; with his defense in 2015 and 2016 combined, according to one estimate, which is one of the best performances for an outfielder during this time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One would guess Cub pitchers lately were allowing balls to leave opposing bats with greater exit velocity and launch angle, although I do not have updated statistics on those parameters. The Cubs &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pressherald.com/2016/07/10/major-league-notebook-cubs-ready-for-rest/&quot;&gt;need some rest&lt;/a&gt;, according to Maddon. That’s as good a recommendation as any, especially for the starting pitchers.    </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/7949511249287911795/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=7949511249287911795&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7949511249287911795'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7949511249287911795'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2016/07/whats-up-or-in-this-case-down-with-cubs.html' title='What’s Up (Or In This Case, Down) With the Cubs?'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Jdz-QDVlrz8/V4iPlG1kwBI/AAAAAAAADhs/oJYg7HhNDu0s7KxYkvBHx1brTFMLCb9RgCLcB/s72-c/cubs%2B1.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-2653654987397924246</id><published>2016-07-09T08:56:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2016-07-09T09:35:30.270-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Serena Williams Just Keeps Winning Grand Slam Titles</title><content type='html'>Serena Williams continues to defy the age curve, &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/tennis/wimbledon16/story/_/id/16922072/2016-wimbledon-serena-williams-wins-22nd-grand-slam-title-tie-steffi-graf-open-era-record&quot;&gt;winning the Wimbledon women&#39;s singles title&lt;/a&gt; earlier today.

In baseball, a streak of getting at least one hit per game, while not an easy task, still allows a batter to make one or more outs per game and still potentially preserve the streak. A streak of getting hits in numerous consecutive &lt;i&gt;at-bats&lt;/i&gt;, on the other hand, has no margin for error. You make an out and the streak is over.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I further noted in the book (page 5), the Major League record for most consecutive at-bats getting a hit each time is 12, co-held by Mike &quot;Pinky&quot; Higgins (1938) and Walt Dropo (1952). Think of that: 12 straight hits without making an out! (Because walks and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/At_bat&quot;&gt;certain other outcomes&lt;/a&gt; do not count as official at-bats, players could have walked during their streaks.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Shortly after my book came out, Trent McCotter, a leading authority on baseball records and old-time hitting streaks, e-mailed me that, &quot;You can also add Johnny Kling, 1902, to that list [with Higgins and Dropo].  I discovered it a few years back.&quot; Trent informed me that the famous Elias Sports Bureau accepted this change, and indeed, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.esb.com/cms/assets/ebbr-2013-sample.pdf&quot;&gt;recent versions of the Elias record book&lt;/a&gt; list Kling with Higgins and Dropo.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I saved Trent&#39;s message for the next time I wrote about hit streaks in consecutive at-bats, not exactly knowing when that might be. A few months ago, the topic returned, and I have waited until the start of the new baseball season to write about it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While browsing in a used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/Ralphs-Records-357424497546/&quot;&gt;record/CD/DVD store&lt;/a&gt;, which also had a small section on baseball cards, I came upon a Walt Dropo card, which I promptly purchased.

With so much else going on in the sports world such as March Madness, the Masters, and the Warriors&#39; quest for 73 wins, I just wasn&#39;t following the start of the MLB season that closely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Something has happened in the young baseball season, however, to make a streaks aficionado such as myself take notice. Namely, Story hit two home runs last Monday in his first-ever major-league game and he&#39;s maintained a streak of homering at least once in all four of the Rockies&#39; games! I&#39;ve created the following chart (which you can click to enlarge) to document all of Story&#39;s plate-appearances so far this season. (Each game appears on a new line. The numbers after ground-outs [G] and fly-outs [F] are standard &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball_positions&quot;&gt;fielding position numbers&lt;/a&gt; and other abbreviations are explained at the bottom of the chart.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JgqqyJplexM/Vwl23pknwdI/AAAAAAAADbE/sIP5HE5CHBUjxspaw7We98prshzdOMFqw/s1600/trevor%2Bstory%2Bhr%2Bburst.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-JgqqyJplexM/Vwl23pknwdI/AAAAAAAADbE/sIP5HE5CHBUjxspaw7We98prshzdOMFqw/s400/trevor%2Bstory%2Bhr%2Bburst.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As this &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=360408127&quot;&gt;article from last night&#39;s game&lt;/a&gt; documents, &quot;Story became the first major leaguer to homer in each of his first four games.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/2016/04/09/trevor-story-what-you-need-know-rockies-breakout-performer/82828540/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; notes that, even throwing non-rookies into the mix, Story is just the &quot;[f]ifth player to homer in four straight games to start a season, joining Baltimore Orioles&#39; Chris Davis (2013), Texas&#39; Nelson Cruz (2011), St. Louis&#39; Mark McGwire (1998) and San Francisco&#39;s Willie Mays (1971).&quot; Pretty good company!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the above chart reveals, Story has entered the big leagues as a free-swinger. He has no walks in his first 19 plate appearances. In addition to his six home runs, he has four strikeouts (three swinging), seven fly-outs (which includes line-drives), one ground-out, and one single.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Rockies host the Padres again tonight, with the Colorado rookie trying to homer in his fifth straight game.

His Sooner squad will face Villanova, with North Carolina and Syracuse meeting in the other semifinal.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hield has been a rare entity this season -- an actual streaky shooter -- going through sizable stretches of hot shooting, as well as of more mediocre marksmanship. In each of OU&#39;s final five non-conference games (from December 12-25), Hield shot .500 or better on threes, with at least five attempts in each contest (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/player/gamelog/_/id/61663/buddy-hield&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first graph below shows Hield&#39;s game-by-game success from behind the three-point arc beginning with the start of Big 12 conference play (you can click on the graphics to enlarge them). After a rough outing at Iowa State in the opener (2-of-9), the senior guard went on a tear of eight straight games shooting .500 or better from long distance (the sizes of the basketball icons are proportional to the number of shots taken in each game, and the opponents are indicated by two-letter abbreviations, which is all I could fit in).* At roughly the midpoint of conference play, Hield&#39;s hot shooting was bringing him a lot of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/big12/2016/01/29/oklahoma-buddy-hield-shooter-basketball-player-of-the-year-candidate/79475822/&quot;&gt;media attention&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mN0dPsvN1Yo/Vv6rH7ELRdI/AAAAAAAADaA/vbM7snr92DMt3odb8T09HneHibXVIl2og/s1600/hield%2B1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;258&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mN0dPsvN1Yo/Vv6rH7ELRdI/AAAAAAAADaA/vbM7snr92DMt3odb8T09HneHibXVIl2og/s400/hield%2B1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hield cooled down during the latter part of Big 12 play, however, shooting in the .300s on treys in seven of OU&#39;s last 10 regular-season games (and never higher than .462 during this span). The Big 12 tournament did go well either for Hield, as he shot .333 (2-of-6) in a win over Iowa State and .167 (1-of-6) in a loss to West Virginia.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once NCAA-tournament action got underway, Hield began to reverse his regular-season slump. In OU&#39;s first game, against Cal State Bakersfield (abbreviated as &quot;BK&quot; on the horizontal axis), Hield hit 50% of his three-pointers (3-of-6), his first time at the break-even point in his last 13 games. A .429 (6-of-14) outing against VCU was solid, if not spectacular. Then, after regressing to .286 (2-of-7) vs. Texas A&amp;amp;M, Hield broke out with a .615 (8-of-13) performance from downtown in the Sooners&#39; regional-final rout of Oregon.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hield&#39;s March Madness upturn has involved only a few games, however, so whether or not he&#39;s really &quot;back&quot; remains open to debate. Using the statistical technique of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/12/after-22-games-this-season-o.html&quot;&gt;local (or &quot;loess&quot;) regression&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to discern larger trends, the results are inconclusive. If the analysis is specified to be highly sensitive or reactive to changes occurring over small numbers of games (left graph, below), there does appear to be a modest NCAA-tournament rise for Hield. However, if the analysis is programmed to less sensitivity and reactivity, and greater smoothness (right graph), no recent rise is detectable&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_25GqBzw_b8/Vv6rPYneoiI/AAAAAAAADaE/6nULcajqwy0FEE89QpZoJ0JeQEpIhdUuQ/s1600/hield%2B2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;143&quot; src=&quot;https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_25GqBzw_b8/Vv6rPYneoiI/AAAAAAAADaE/6nULcajqwy0FEE89QpZoJ0JeQEpIhdUuQ/s400/hield%2B2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So whether Hield has regained his yield is unclear. Until tomorrow...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;*For fans of the Big 12, the abbreviations should be interpretable, albeit odd (e.g., &quot;TC&quot; instead of TCU, &quot;KS&quot; for Kansas State). In the midst of conference play, Oklahoma took on LSU (&quot;LS&quot;) in the Big 12/SEC Challenge. In the NCAA tournament, BK = Cal State Bakersfield, VC = Virginia Commonwealth, AM = Texas A&amp;amp;M, and OR = Oregon.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/5081929964369022464/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=5081929964369022464&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/5081929964369022464'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/5081929964369022464'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2016/04/has-buddy-hield-regained-his-yield.html' title='Has Buddy Hield Regained His Yield?'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mN0dPsvN1Yo/Vv6rH7ELRdI/AAAAAAAADaA/vbM7snr92DMt3odb8T09HneHibXVIl2og/s72-c/hield%2B1.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-3726624294277833149</id><published>2016-03-16T22:44:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2016-03-16T23:03:38.106-07:00</updated><title type='text'>&quot;Explosiveness&quot; of NCAA Men&#39;s Basketball High Seeds</title><content type='html'>With the annual NCAA men&#39;s basketball tournament getting underway, I wanted to apply a measure I originally developed for the Golden State Warriors, namely offensive &quot;explosiveness,&quot; to the leading teams in March Madness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reuters news-agency blogger Chris Taylor contacted me a week ago, as part of his investigation of statistical tools that might inform March Madness predictions. I told him about explosiveness, which he included among his &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/article/us-money-sports-gambling-idUSKCN0WG1S7&quot;&gt;Seven tips for crunching March Madness math&lt;/a&gt;.&quot; As Taylor characterized my explanation of why one might want to study explosiveness, &quot;Winning teams need to be able to come back from behind, or pull away [in] close games.&quot; It remains to be seen whether explosiveness has any predictive power in this year&#39;s NCAA tourney. However, as I told Taylor somewhat flippantly, &quot;It seems to work for Golden State!&quot; &amp;nbsp;In the remainder of this posting, I discuss explosiveness in greater detail.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The explosiveness statistic measures high-scoring bursts in short stretches of time. Instead of looking at 12-minute quarters in the NBA, I looked at 6-minute &quot;eighths&quot; of games. An explosive burst in NBA play is defined as scoring 18 or more points in 6 minutes (3 points per minute), which if maintained over an entire 48-minute game would yield a whopping 144 points. In the Warriors&#39; first 25 games of the present season, in &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-importance-of-six-minute-scoring.html&quot;&gt;nearly one-fourth of all their 6-minute blocks&lt;/a&gt; did they register an explosive burst.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the 40-minute length of college-basketball games, I looked at 5-minute blocks (one-eighth of regulation game-length) to see how often teams scored 15 or more points (i.e., 3 points per minute). Due to time constraints, I analyzed only the top eight projected teams in the field (i.e., all the No. 1 and 2 seeds in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://i.turner.ncaa.com/sites/default/files/external/printable-bracket/2016/bracket-ncaa.pdf&quot;&gt;bracket&lt;/a&gt;) and looked only at each of these teams&#39; final 10 regular-season games. I did not include overtime periods, so each team had a total of 80 5-minute blocks. As shown in the following table (on which you can click to enlarge), the eight teams varied greatly in their explosiveness.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Zqr2TJ9NlBA/VuoyA2FAy_I/AAAAAAAADZw/otk9_lEAPkAXWHpi9VwTt5465AkrsrJog/s1600/ncaa%2Bexplosiveness.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;210&quot; src=&quot;https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Zqr2TJ9NlBA/VuoyA2FAy_I/AAAAAAAADZw/otk9_lEAPkAXWHpi9VwTt5465AkrsrJog/s400/ncaa%2Bexplosiveness.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As can be seen, Xavier (Ohio), the No. 2 seed in the East region, was the most explosive team among those studied. Playing in the Big East Conference, the Musketeers recorded 13 explosive (15-point or more) bursts in their 80 5-minute blocks. Here are several examples:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In one game alone, vs. Creighton on March 5, the Musketeers pulled off three bursts (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/playbyplay?gameId=400840234&quot;&gt;play-by-play sheet&lt;/a&gt;). Xavier went from having 44 points at halftime to 60 points with 15:00 min remaining; from 66 points with 10:00 left to 82 with 5:00 to go; and 82 with 5:00 left to 98 points at the end.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;At Seton Hall on February 28, a game in which the Musketeers trailed 45-26 at the half and ultimately lost 90-81, Xavier rallied feverishly in the second half. XU went from 43 points with 10:00 left to 58 with 5:00 left; and from 58 with 5:00 left to 81 at the final buzzer, a 23-point super-explosion (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/playbyplay?gameId=400840314&quot;&gt;play-by-play)&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kansas (No. 1 seed in South region) and Oregon (No. 1 in the West) followed with nine explosive bursts each. Oklahoma (No. 2 in West) surprised me with only four bursts, given the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ncaab/big12/2016/01/29/oklahoma-buddy-hield-shooter-basketball-player-of-the-year-candidate/79475822/&quot;&gt;excellent three-point shooting&lt;/a&gt; this season by the Sooners&#39; Buddy Hield. Virginia (No. 1 in the Midwest) had no explosions in its final 10 regular-season games.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I next inquired into what other skills and styles of play might contribute to a team&#39;s explosiveness (or lack thereof). The first things that occurred to me were that an explosive team was likely to play at a fast tempo (i.e., shooting early in the shot clock, generating many possessions per game) and be good at shooting the three. Results only partially supported these hypotheses (see the grey columns in the chart above). Note, however, that whereas explosiveness was only measured in teams&#39; final 10 regular-season games (because combing through play-by-play sheets is time-consuming), all the other statistics are based on teams&#39; full seasons.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Xavier indeed plays at the fastest pace &amp;nbsp;(74.5 possessions per game) among the No. 1 and 2 seeds, corresponding to the Musketeers&#39; explosiveness. However, Oklahoma plays nearly as fast (73.7 possessions per game), but had low explosiveness. Virginia plays at a very slow pace (62.4 possessions per game, dead last among the 351 Division I men&#39;s teams), which seems to go a long way toward explaining the Cavaliers&#39; lack of explosiveness. (Tempo/possession statistics are available &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teamrankings.com/ncaa-basketball/stat/possessions-per-game&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Kansas, with nine explosive bursts, thrives on the three-pointer. Not only do the Jayhawks have one of the nation&#39;s highest shooting percentages from behind the arc; they also are &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/bill-self-is-finally-warming-up-to-the-3-pointer/&quot;&gt;attempting more treys&lt;/a&gt; than they have in the past. (All shooting, rebounding, and defensive statistics cited here are from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ncaa.com/stats/basketball-men/d1&quot;&gt;NCAA statistics webpage&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Michigan State, with seven explosive bursts, is first in the nation in two categories: three-point shooting percentage and defensive rebounds per game. Limiting opponents to one shot and making shots yourself should contribute to explosiveness. However, the Spartans are quite low in turnovers forced per game, which presumably works against MSU being able to score quickly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Oklahoma, which shoots well, cleans the defensive glass, and plays relatively fast, remains an enigma.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Keep an eye out for whether the eight teams seeded No. 1 or 2 make it to the Final Four. Either the explosiveness statistic will go out with a bang or be a dud.&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/3726624294277833149/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=3726624294277833149&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3726624294277833149'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3726624294277833149'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2016/03/explosiveness-of-highly-seeded-ncaa.html' title='&quot;Explosiveness&quot; of NCAA Men&#39;s Basketball High Seeds'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Zqr2TJ9NlBA/VuoyA2FAy_I/AAAAAAAADZw/otk9_lEAPkAXWHpi9VwTt5465AkrsrJog/s72-c/ncaa%2Bexplosiveness.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-9075451824108619962</id><published>2016-01-21T17:55:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2016-01-21T17:55:30.278-08:00</updated><title type='text'>A Decade of UConn Women&#39;s Basketball Wins and Losses, At a Glance</title><content type='html'>Last Friday, ESPN.com ran a piece documenting the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/blog/statsinfo/post/_/id/113704/what-are-the-best-100-game-stretches-across-the-major-sports&quot;&gt;best 100-game stretches&lt;/a&gt; in U.S. college sports and major pro leagues such as the NBA, NFL, NHL, and MLB. At the time the article appeared, the University of Connecticut (UConn) women&#39;s basketball program had won 99 of its last 100 games (now 101 of its last 102). The legendary UCLA men&#39;s basketball program under coach John Wooden also had recorded a 99-1 stretch, from 1971-74.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The UConn women under coach Geno Auriemma &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geno_Auriemma&quot;&gt;have been dominant&lt;/a&gt; since winning the first of their 10 NCAA national times (and compiling the first of their five undefeated seasons) in 1995. I, therefore, wanted to look at the Huskies&#39; long-term success beyond their past 100 games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to examine UConn&#39;s last 400 games, representing roughly the past decade of play. The Huskies&#39; past 400 games span from the opening game of the 2005-06 season all the way to last night, when UConn &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uconnhuskies.com/sports/w-baskbl/recaps/012016aaa.html&quot;&gt;routed Central Florida&lt;/a&gt;, 106-51. In these games, the Huskies are 377-23 (.942).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This record appears more compelling, in my view, when viewed in graphic form. I&#39;ve thus created a diagram that shows 400 dots (one for each game), with wins depicted in &lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;blue&lt;/span&gt; and losses in &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;red&lt;/span&gt;. The games are arranged in chronological sequence, from the first contest in the upper-left corner, advancing across each row of dots, until the 400th game in the lower-right corner. Here&#39;s the diagram:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LFnavLsOsDk/VqGKCXG5IgI/AAAAAAAADYc/-NSIcVG694E/s1600/uconn%2Bwomen%2B400%2Bgames.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;161&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LFnavLsOsDk/VqGKCXG5IgI/AAAAAAAADYc/-NSIcVG694E/s400/uconn%2Bwomen%2B400%2Bgames.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Pretty blue, huh? I can&#39;t think of a way to convey the Huskies&#39; dominance any more dramatically. The picture includes both a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.uconnhuskies.com/sports/w-baskbl/recaps/122910aaa.html&quot;&gt;90-game winning streak&lt;/a&gt; (the NCAA Division I record among men or women) and the current 101-1 stretch, as indicated by the side annotations. To help with interpretation of the diagram, I also created the following legend:&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2xeiYmLTWeo/VqGLHix-pyI/AAAAAAAADYo/kWfdbyH3Egs/s1600/uconn%2B400%2Blegend.jpg.gif&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;188&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-2xeiYmLTWeo/VqGLHix-pyI/AAAAAAAADYo/kWfdbyH3Egs/s400/uconn%2B400%2Blegend.jpg.gif&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;(You can click on the graphics to enlarge them.)&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/9075451824108619962/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=9075451824108619962&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/9075451824108619962'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/9075451824108619962'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2016/01/a-decade-of-uconn-womens-basketball.html' title='A Decade of UConn Women&#39;s Basketball Wins and Losses, At a Glance'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-LFnavLsOsDk/VqGKCXG5IgI/AAAAAAAADYc/-NSIcVG694E/s72-c/uconn%2Bwomen%2B400%2Bgames.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-3124023940186977430</id><published>2015-12-25T13:43:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2016-01-26T20:41:30.549-08:00</updated><title type='text'>The Importance of Six-Minute Scoring Spurts in the Warriors’ Winning Streak </title><content type='html'>Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As part of the NBA&#39;s package of Christmas telecasts, the champion Golden State Warriors (27-1) will host Cleveland (19-7) in a rematch of last season&#39;s finals. The Warriors have been the big story of the 2015-16 season, &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/gs&quot;&gt;starting out 24-0&lt;/a&gt; (a 28-game regular-season winning streak if one includes the last four games of the previous season) to threaten the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers&#39; record &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2007/01/today-is-35th-anniversary-of-ending-of.html&quot;&gt;33-game winning streak&lt;/a&gt;. After a December 12 loss at Milwaukee to end the streak, Golden State has won three in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On this holiday occasion, I&#39;d like to look back on the Warriors&#39; winning streak, using an unusual lens. Offense is the team&#39;s forte, as seen in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/team/_/stat/team-comparison-per-game/year/2015&quot;&gt;NBA team-scoring rankings&lt;/a&gt;. Some basketball analysts look at statistics such as teams’ points per game or points per 100 possessions. To understand the Golden State Warriors’ success over the past season and a half, in my view, we have to look at smaller segments of play. Not halves, not quarters, but six-minute “eighths” of games. When the first-quarter clock runs down from 12:00 to 6:01, that would be the first eighth; from 6:00 to 0:00, the second. The eighth and final eighth would run from 6:00 to 0:00 of the fourth quarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 2015 playoffs, the Warriors played 21 games and thus 168 eighths of basketball (overtimes are not counted within my analyses). In 22 of these 168 eighths (13%), Golden State scored 18 or more points, which translates into 3 or more points per minute. If a team maintained a 3-points/minute pace for a full 48-minute game, it would score 144 points. Thus, I use 18+ point eighths as a marker of offensive explosiveness. The 22 eighths in which the Dubs scored 18+ points during these playoffs included three of 24 points (4 points per minute) and one of 25 points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Through the Warriors’ first 25 games of the 2015-16 season – 24 wins followed by a loss – they have recorded 46 eighths of 18+ points in the 200 eighths they’ve played (23%). (Given that opposition is stronger in the playoffs than in the regular season, it’s not surprising that Golden State’s percentage of eighths with 18+ points is higher in the latter.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Warriors’ best eighth of the current season, as far as I can tell, occurred in the last six minutes of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=400828201&quot;&gt;first quarter&lt;/a&gt; on December 8 at Indiana. After scoring 17 points in the first 6:00 of the quarter, the Dubs added 27 points in the latter half of the first quarter (the second eighth of the game). This explosion included four treys (plus Klay Thompson making all three free throws after being fouled behind the arc).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After the Warriors’ 114-98 &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400828187&quot;&gt;win at Brooklyn&lt;/a&gt; to go 22-0, acting coach Luke Walton was quoted as saying that, &quot;It&#39;s one of our biggest strengths, is that we&#39;re never out of a game and we&#39;re always one little run away from putting a game away.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The following graph plots Golden State&#39;s points scored in the final 6:00 (the eighth eighth) of their first 25 games this season, as a function the number of points by which they were leading or trailing with 6:00 minutes left in regulation, We see that the Warriors’ greatest scoring outbursts in the final eighth have occurred when they have trailed or been tied heading into them. (For those with some statistical training, the correlation between Warriors’ margin entering the final eighth and their points scored in the final eighth is &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = -.52, &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .01.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zxF4sVSHG1k/Vn2yjZxb2DI/AAAAAAAADUc/tNdeoCi23-c/s1600/warriors%2Bstreak.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;362&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zxF4sVSHG1k/Vn2yjZxb2DI/AAAAAAAADUc/tNdeoCi23-c/s400/warriors%2Bstreak.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In some ways, this finding is totally intuitive. Trailing or being tied should motivate a team (especially one, such as the Warriors, who were trying to maintain a long winning streak) to play extra hard; conversely, when a team is way ahead, it likely will put reserves in the game and run time off the clock, both resulting in lower offensive output. In another way, however, the finding is not so intuitive. If you’re trailing or tied late in the game, it could mean you are playing a tough opponent and/or having an off-night, which are not conducive to big scoring runs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above graph also shows that failure to respond as expected is what put the Warriors’ winning streak in jeopardy in Game 24 at Boston (a double-overtime Golden State win) and helped end it the next night in Milwaukee. According to the trend-line projection, the Dubs would have been expected to score 17 or 18 points in the final eighth of the Celtics game, but instead scored only 12 (this discrepancy is depicted by the red dashed vertical line). Trailing by 13 at Milwaukee, Golden State would have been expected to put up 20 in the final six minutes, but instead scored only 15.* Given that the Boston and Milwaukee games were the sixth and seventh of a seven-game road trip, the late-game loss of the Warriors’ explosiveness doesn’t seem surprising.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don’t expect media outlets to replace the standard quarter-based line-score with one organized by eighths. For highly explosive teams such as the Warriors, however, I do believe eighths are a useful lens for statistical analysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;*The Warriors lost to Milwaukee by 13 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400828238&quot;&gt;108-95&lt;/a&gt;), so strictly speaking, even if Golden State had scored the extra five points predicted by the correlational analysis, it still would have lost. Had the Warriors shown more offensive prowess in the final 6:00, however, the Bucks might have begun to feel pressure and perhaps the ending would have unfolded differently.   </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/3124023940186977430/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=3124023940186977430&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3124023940186977430'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3124023940186977430'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2015/12/the-importance-of-six-minute-scoring.html' title='The Importance of Six-Minute Scoring Spurts in the Warriors’ Winning Streak '/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-zxF4sVSHG1k/Vn2yjZxb2DI/AAAAAAAADUc/tNdeoCi23-c/s72-c/warriors%2Bstreak.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-5334488793403071067</id><published>2015-12-12T20:01:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2015-12-12T20:03:58.700-08:00</updated><title type='text'>It&#39;s Over!

The NBA record for longest winning streak is, of course, the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2007/01/today-is-35th-anniversary-of-ending-of.html&quot;&gt;33-game stretch&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So the Warriors are 10 wins shy of the record. Well, not necessarily. Golden State &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/gs/year/2015/golden-state-warriors&quot;&gt;won its last four regular-season games&lt;/a&gt; of the previous season, so it is technically accurate to say the &quot;Dubs,&quot; as they&#39;re sometimes called, have won 27 straight &lt;i&gt;regular-season&lt;/i&gt; games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After I mentioned on Twitter the idea of counting the last four games of 2014-15, Lakers fan&lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/slowshi&quot;&gt; Len Lester&lt;/a&gt; tweeted at me that &quot;if you&#39;re carrying over last season gotta include post season too.&quot; The Warriors won the NBA title last season, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/gs/year/2015/seasontype/3/golden-state-warriors&quot;&gt;lost a combined five games&lt;/a&gt; in the playoffs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In thinking about Len&#39;s point, I have to admit that it&#39;s more than a little odd to claim a continuous win streak from April 2015 (when the regular season ended) to the present, when Golden State &lt;i&gt;lost&lt;/i&gt; five games in between.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hypothetically, if the Warriors get to 30-0 just in the current season and then lose -- giving them 34 straight wins over two regular seasons -- I suspect the NBA might create two entries in its record book: longest winning streak within a single regular season, and longest regular-season winning streak spanning multiple seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve added a poll in the right-hand column, so readers can vote on whether the last four wins of the previous season should be added to Golden State&#39;s current total.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/4886884953771432313/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=4886884953771432313&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4886884953771432313'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4886884953771432313'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2015/12/should-warriors-4-wins-at-end-of-2014.html' title='Should Warriors&#39; 4 Wins at End of 2014-15 Regular Season Count as Part of Current Winning Streak?'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-6385801212021111927</id><published>2015-10-26T08:38:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2015-10-26T08:48:15.613-07:00</updated><title type='text'>A (Somewhat) Unusual Aspect of Daniel Murphy&#39;s Postseason Home-Run Streak</title><content type='html'>As we approach the opening of the 2015 World Series on Tuesday night, the dominant story line has been the home-run streak of Mets second-baseman Daniel Murphy. He has hit a &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/gamelog/_/id/29200/daniel-murphy&quot;&gt;home-run in each of his last six games&lt;/a&gt;, a playoff record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One of the key principles I&#39;ve gleaned through nearly 15 years of hot-hand research is that long streaks are most likely to be achieved by players and teams with very high baseline success rates.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The late Harvard paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/1988/aug/18/the-streak-of-streaks/&quot;&gt;famously wrote that&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Long streaks always are, and must be, a matter of extraordinary luck imposed upon great skill.&quot; Thus, if you look at some of longest streaks in American sports history -- 88 straight wins by John Wooden&#39;s UCLA men&#39;s basketball teams of the 1970s, and 90 by Gino Auriemma&#39;s UConn women of the 2000s; Joe DiMaggio&#39;s 56-game hitting streak; and Tiger Woods making the cut in 142 straight golf tournaments -- these are all athletes and teams that generally succeeded an enormously high percent of the time. Throw in a little luck to avoid a loss in a close game (or a hitless game or missed cut) and, voila, you have a long streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Murphy, however, does not have a high base rate of home-run production, &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/stats/_/id/29200/daniel-murphy&quot;&gt;never hitting more than 14&lt;/a&gt; in any of his seven regular seasons, and averaging about nine per year. A home-run streak by Murphy is therefore more out-of-the-ordinary than, say, one by Mike Trout would be. (Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/a-run-like-the-mets-daniel-murphys-should-happen-once-every-two-years/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a statistical analysis taking this approach.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second unusual feature of Murphy&#39;s streak -- and perhaps I&#39;m being too picky -- is that, when a player goes on a monster home-run tear, there&#39;s a good chance he&#39;ll have one or more multi-homer games within the streak. Murphy has not, hitting exactly one homer per game during his streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In September 2010, for example, then-Colorado shortstop Troy Tulowitzki hit &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2010/09/im-little-behind-curve-on-this.html&quot;&gt;14 home-runs in a 15-game span&lt;/a&gt;, including four multi-homer games. (Playing at homer-friendly Coors Field for many of those games probably helped.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Then there&#39;s the case of Hee-Seop Choi, whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/c/choihe01.shtml&quot;&gt;brief MLB career&lt;/a&gt; included a weekend in June 2005 in which, playing for the Dodgers he belted &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=250612119&quot;&gt;six home-runs in a three-game series&lt;/a&gt; vs. the Twins (two, one, and three homers, respectively, on Friday, Saturday, and Sunday). He hit only three more homers the rest of the season and never played in the majors after 2005.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, when we look at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/play-index/share.cgi?id=ZAxHi&quot;&gt;players Murphy surpassed&lt;/a&gt; for most consecutive postseason games with a homer, the tendency for multi-homer games to be embedded within the streaks is there (highlighted in yellow).

Hitting one home-run in each of six straight games, as Murphy has done, is amazing.

The conference was mentioned three days ago in a &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; interview with Oakland A&#39;s General Manager Billy Beane and Boston Red Sox adviser Bill James (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-discussion-with-baseball-revolutionaries-billy-beane-and-bill-james-1442854375&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;). My friend Mike Gustafson, remembering that I had attended the conference, brought the WSJ article to my attention (Thanks Mike!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Reference to the Arizona meeting came up almost by accident in the interview, in response to a question about a different topic. Here&#39;s the relevant part of the article:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;WSJ:&lt;/b&gt; Is there another sport that stands out to either of you as being most ripe for the kind of revolution baseball has undergone with analytics?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;James:&lt;/b&gt; Football, from a popular perception angle, has lots of openings for analysts to rush in. There’s been this ongoing debate in football. Billy and I met in Arizona. When was that?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Beane:&lt;/b&gt; 2000, 2001 maybe. It was a little half-conference that Bill had and I joined him for. It was before the book.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;James:&lt;/b&gt; The guy who put it together was a distinguished economist from the University of Chicago. One thing we talked about then, I remember, there was a guy from AT&amp;amp;T who studies football, and he was arguing then that it’s foolish for football coaches to punt in many situations in which they actually do punt...  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Beane was a couple of years off, and the football analyst mentioned by James is &lt;a href=&quot;http://eml.berkeley.edu//~dromer/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;David Romer&lt;/a&gt; of UC Berkeley (not AT&amp;amp;T, unless he did research for the telecommunications giant at some other point in his career). Other than that, however, Beane and James were pretty accurate about the conference. Here&#39;s a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nber.org/papers/w9024&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; to Romer&#39;s paper, by the way.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My connection is that, along with Tom Gilovich, I was representing hot-hand research. Most of the participants in the meeting are shown in the following photo (with a legend to identify participants at the very bottom of this posting).

Among his other accomplishments, Thaler co-authored the book&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://yalepress.yale.edu/Book.asp?isbn=9780300122237&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Nudge&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in 2008. Thaler co-organized the conference with&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://psych.indiana.edu/faculty/sherman.php&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jim Sherman&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;of Indiana University (standing next to Thaler). Beane is not shown in the photo, as he was busy overseeing the A&#39;s from their nearby spring-training complex and took time from his day to come by the conference to speak at one session.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;One broad theme addressed at the conference was the future of systematic empirical research in guiding sports teams&#39; decision-making. Twelve years post-conference, I think it&#39;s safe to say that the use of such research has expanded dramatically beyond the A&#39;s, Red Sox, and any other teams that were looking at sabermetrics in 2003.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In 2015,&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;ESPN The Magazine&lt;/i&gt;, which has been issuing an annual Sports Analytics Issue for at least the past few years, &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/espn/feature/story/_/id/12331388/the-great-analytics-rankings&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;ranked all MLB, NBA, NHL, and NFL franchises on their commitment to sabermetrics&lt;/a&gt;, using a five-level scale (All-In, Believers, One Foot In, Skeptics, and Non-Believers). With the exception of the NFL (where no teams were listed as All-In), the combined total for All-In and Believers exceeded that for Skeptics and Non-Believers in all sports.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Another indicator is the annual MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, the history of which is documented &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sloansportsconference.com/?page_id=490&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The inaugural meeting in 2007 was held on the MIT campus and attracted approximately 175 people. By 2015, attendance had jumped to 3,200, with the festivities now being held in a large convention center. Three league commissioners (NBA, MLB, and Major League Soccer) spoke at the 2015 conference.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Here&#39;s the legend identifying participants in the 2003 Scottsdale conference.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1QlqPMfDaTs/VgPxZ7arrSI/AAAAAAAADPY/aOLFeGkbHvU/s1600/arizona%2Bconf%2Blegend.png&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;282&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-1QlqPMfDaTs/VgPxZ7arrSI/AAAAAAAADPY/aOLFeGkbHvU/s320/arizona%2Bconf%2Blegend.png&quot; width=&quot;320&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/1438666374428096149/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=1438666374428096149&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/1438666374428096149'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/1438666374428096149'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2015/09/wall-street-journal-interview-with.html' title='This Week&#39;s Wall Street Journal Interview with Billy Beane and Bill James, and the 2003 Scottsdale, Arizona Informal Sports-Analytics Conference'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-wPPgfcwLkLU/VgPxPlWZF8I/AAAAAAAADPQ/QvSYhbRtUQc/s72-c/2003%2Barizona%2Bsports%2Bconf.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-8968210688085022525</id><published>2015-08-01T12:09:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2015-08-01T12:29:40.867-07:00</updated><title type='text'>New Study of NBA 3-PT Contest Heats Up Hot-Hand Debates</title><content type='html'>A new study of NBA All-Star Weekend three-point shooting contests by Joshua Miller and Adam Sanjurjo, posted to the Social Science Research Network (&lt;a href=&quot;http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2611987&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;), has re-ignited debates over the magnitude of hot-hand effects on basketball shooting. Miller and Sanjurjo have identified a bias in certain types of hot-hand calculations that appears to have led to underestimation of hot-hand effects in previous studies. While there appears to be a broad consensus (including the present writer) on the validity of Miller and Sanjurjo&#39;s point, numerous other issues are being debated among the lead writers and commentators on various sports blogs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First off, let&#39;s review the aforementioned bias. Miller and Sanjurjo, as have others, compared basketball shooters&#39; hit rates when hot (in this case, following three straight made shots) to their hit rates following three-shot sequences other than three straight hits (when players are less hot or even cold). The authors&#39; SSRN paper notes that distortion stems from the fact that &quot;conditioning on a streak of three or more hits creates a selection bias in which these hits are removed from the sample, leaving a smaller fraction of hits, thus driving conditional performance on the subsequent shot below the base rate&quot; (p. 9). Here&#39;s a concrete illustration. Using part of an example Miller shared in an e-mail, where H = hit and M = miss, the sequence [&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;HHH&lt;/span&gt;M&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;HHH&lt;/span&gt;M] would yield the not-so-hot result that the player was 0-for-2 on shots following three straight hits, even though the player&#39;s overall shooting (6-of-8) was very hot. Further, with a correction formula devised by Miller and Sanjuro, hot-hand effects now appear to be larger than previously thought (at least within this type of analysis).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This finding has sent statistically oriented bloggers to their keyboards with great urgency. Columbia University statistics professor Andrew Gelman headlined his &lt;a href=&quot;http://andrewgelman.com/2015/07/09/hey-guess-what-there-really-is-a-hot-hand/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;July 9 posting&lt;/a&gt; &quot;Hey -- guess what? There really is a hot hand!&quot; The last I checked, Gelman&#39;s piece had received 105 comments! Then, on July 21, all-around sabermetrician Phil Birnbaum weighed in on his blog with a posting entitled &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.philbirnbaum.com/2015/07/a-hot-hand-is-found-for-nba-three-point.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;A &#39;hot hand&#39; is found in the NBA three-point contest&lt;/a&gt;.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though some of the commenters on these blogs have gone back and forth over the proper magnitude of the correction for the aforementioned bias and other methodological issues, I think it&#39;s easiest to take Miller and Sanjurjo&#39;s findings at face value. Table 1 of their paper is very informative, presenting results for 33 players, with and without bias-correction. The authors correctly note that, when averaging over players, those with negative results (shooting worse after a hot streak) can cancel out positive results. A simple look at the frequencies of different results therefore seems warranted, so I have summarized the results concisely from Miller and Sanjurjo&#39;s more-elaborate table. Even with the bias-correction (which enhances how streaky a player looks), here&#39;s how many players show different increases in shooting percentage conditional on making three straight shots:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #ffcc33; border-collapse: collapse; border: 1px solid #FFFF66; color: black; width: 40%;&quot;&gt; &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accuracy Gain&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;After 3 Straight&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Hits (&quot;Hotness&quot;)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;No. of&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Contestants&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;.34&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;.20 to .22&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;.14 to .18&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;.11 to .12&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;.05 to .07&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;.01 to .04&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;10&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Negative&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;5&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miller and Sanjurjo&#39;s claim that &lt;i&gt;some&lt;/i&gt; players exhibit quite appreciable streakiness is well-supported. What about the &quot;typical&quot; or &quot;average&quot; performance? The median for all players (which is unaffected by how far in a positive or negative direction the most extreme values sit) is a .05 or 5% improvement after making three straight shots (16 players above .05, 2 at .05, and 15 below it). This is indeed stronger evidence for basketball-shooting streakiness than we&#39;ve seen before. For example, a Harvard study (Bocskocsky, Ezekowitz &amp;amp; Stein, 2014) found approximately a 2% hot-hand increase for NBA in-game shooting, using &lt;a href=&quot;http://stats.nba.com/tracking/#!/player/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;SportVU tracking-camera &amp;nbsp;technology&lt;/a&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/2014_SSAC_The-Hot-Hand-A-New-Approach.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostonglobe.com/ideas/2014/02/09/the-hot-hand-might-real-after-all/N8V34bGLWhPqk0Sx9yoHWI/story.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There are a couple of possible reasons why Miller and Sanjurjo&#39;s findings may overstate hot-hand effects. As Birnbaum notes, within the 25-shot sequence of the NBA three-point contest, there are five locations, from each of which the player attempts five straight shots. Thus, if a shooter hits his first shot from a given location, he can rely on the same motor/muscle memory in launching the next four shots.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further, players invited to the NBA three-point-shooting contest are known to be great outside shooters, and players with high base rates of success appear more likely than those with lower base rates to go on hot streaks. Therefore, it would be interesting to see what would happen with a more representative cross-section of NBA players. (Both the motor/muscle-memory and base-rate issues are discussed in my book.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if Miller and Sanjurjo&#39;s 5% median hot-hand effect is not inflated, it is still probably a smaller magnitude than most fans would associate with the term &quot;hot hand,&quot; as the authors appear to acknowledge. The double-digit percentage-point increases some shooters exhibit after three straight hits, on the other hand, would seem to be closer to a lay characterization of a hot hand.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition, Miller, in comments on the Gelman blog, holds the Harvard study to a very high level of scrutiny, in my view. Arguably, too high. For example, Miller notes that it omitted some possible control variables, including &quot;the quality and identity of the defender.&quot; However, the Harvard study did control for &quot;Distance of Closest Defender, Angle of Closest Defender, Shooter-Defender Height Difference, and [whether the shooter was] Double Covered.&quot; Once all these facets of the defense are accounted for, I don&#39;t know how much incremental knowledge we gain from knowing the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.teamrankings.com/nba/player-stat/defensive-plays-per-foul&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;defensive-efficiency&lt;/a&gt; of the player guarding the shooter. I therefore take the Harvard study&#39;s 2% estimate of a hot-hand magnitude as having probative value.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the end, I come down closer to Birnbaum&#39;s relatively skeptical view -- including his point that Miller and Sanjurjo&#39;s finding should be described as &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&quot; hot hand, rather than &quot;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;the&lt;/span&gt;&quot; hot hand, because, like all studies, it is context-dependent -- than Gelman&#39;s more accepting position. Miller and Sanjurjo&#39;s hotness magnitudes for the hottest-shooting players are higher than I would have guessed. But the magnitudes for median shooters are only slightly higher than what I would have imagined.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/8968210688085022525/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=8968210688085022525&amp;isPopup=true' title='8 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8968210688085022525'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8968210688085022525'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2015/08/new-study-of-nba-three-point-contest.html' title='New Study of NBA 3-PT Contest Heats Up Hot-Hand Debates'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>8</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-8417812406416962096</id><published>2015-06-25T07:42:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2015-06-25T07:48:31.590-07:00</updated><title type='text'>76er Statistician Harvey Pollack, Who Had a Hand in Hot-Hand Research, Dies at 93</title><content type='html'>As reported in newspapers yesterday,  Philadelphia 76er statistician extraordinaire Harvey Pollack has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/early-lead/wp/2015/06/24/nba-stats-guru-harvey-pollack-dies-at-age-93/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;died at age 93&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, it was Pollack&#39;s knack for quirky and exotic basketball statistics that greatly aided the first scholarly publication on hot-hand research.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The publication I&#39;m referring to, of course, is Tom Gilovich, Robert Vallone, and Amos Tversky&#39;s 1985 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.psych.cornell.edu/sec/pubPeople/tdg1/Gilo.Vallone.Tversky.pdf&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; &quot;The Hot Hand in Basketball: On the Misperception of Random Sequences,&quot; which was published in &lt;i&gt;Cognitive Psychology&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(sometimes referred to as &quot;GVT&quot; in reference to the authors&#39; last initials). Pollack is thanked in GVT&#39;s author notes, and here&#39;s why.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The GVT article included statistical analysis of three basketball-shooting compilations: field-goal shooting in 1980-81 Philadelphia 76er home games; free-throw shooting by the Boston Celtics in 1980-81 and 1981-82; and controlled shooting sessions with Cornell University men&#39;s and women&#39;s players.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of crucial importance is that, except for Pollack and the 76ers, no NBA team kept sequential shooting data on field-goal attempts. Box scores tell us each player&#39;s number of &lt;i&gt;total&lt;/i&gt; field-goal attempts and made attempts, but not the player&#39;s sequence (e.g., hit-miss-miss-hit-hit...). Only because Pollack kept sequential field-goal data for players was this aspect able to be feasibly incorporated into the GVT article.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Nowadays, play-by-play sheets are readily available on the Internet, which would make collecting player sequences reasonably doable. In the early 1980s, however, GVT&#39;s only alternative to Pollack&#39;s numbers would have been to watch large numbers of NBA games (not that they necessarily would have minded) and record sequential data on their own. As Gilovich confirmed for me yesterday, &quot;Harvey was the guy without whom we could not have done our research.

A &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400579145&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;four-game losing streak&lt;/a&gt; in late February put San Antonio at 34-23. Perhaps having the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.therichest.com/sports/basketball-sports/the-10-oldest-teams-in-the-nba-for-the-2014-15-season/10/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;oldest roster in the NBA&lt;/a&gt; was starting to catch up with the Spurs. From that point on, however, Coach Gregg Popovich&#39;s crew went 21-4 to finish with a regular-season record of 55-27. And it wasn&#39;t just quantity of wins, but also quality, as the Spurs&#39; hot streak included a March 22 win at Atlanta, an April 5 home win over Golden State, and a sweep of an April 8/10 home-and-home match-up vs. Houston.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Baseball-statistics maven Bill James has a statistic he calls &quot;temperature&quot; to assess how hot or cold an individual or team is at the moment. According to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hardballtimes.com/tht-live/is-bill-james-temperature-a-leading-indicator/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, the formula adds a standard value to a team&#39;s temperature for each win in a streak, regardless of the quality of opposition and other possible features of each win (e.g., home/away, margin of victory). James&#39;s temperature for individual baseball players&#39; hotness puts &lt;a href=&quot;http://nesn.com/2011/08/bill-james-explains-new-temperature-gauge-statistic-to-determine-how-hot-or-cold-a-hitter-is/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;greater weight on recent&lt;/a&gt; than distant performance, but it&#39;s not clear his team formulas do the same. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I started thinking about a temperature statistic for basketball teams, incorporating quality of opposition (with additional factors such as those listed above possibly being added later). The core concepts are that, against a tough opponent, a win should raise a team&#39;s temperature a lot, but a loss shouldn&#39;t hurt too much. Conversely, against a weak opponent, a loss should be damaging, but a win not very rewarding.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my system, a team starts at the neutral point of 1.00. Then, after each game, the previous value is multiplied by an update factor. The multiplier after a win is (1 + opponent&#39;s winning percentage), so that the better the opponent, the larger the rise in temperature. The multiplier after a loss is &lt;i&gt;just&lt;/i&gt; the opponent&#39;s winning percentage, which will drop the temperature (multiplying anything by a number greater than 1.00 increases value, whereas multiplying something by a number between 0.00-1.00 decreases value). The following graphic (on which you can click to enlarge) provides some examples.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0-Xo_MTAoaw/VTQSYa_RkvI/AAAAAAAAC6A/Jg4ZL6S1O9Q/s1600/streak%2Btemperature%2Bschematic.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0-Xo_MTAoaw/VTQSYa_RkvI/AAAAAAAAC6A/Jg4ZL6S1O9Q/s1600/streak%2Btemperature%2Bschematic.jpg&quot; height=&quot;317&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The opponent&#39;s winning percentage (right before you&#39;ve played them) appears on the horizontal axis, the red and blue lines are used after a win or loss, respectively, and the multiplier after a game appears on the vertical axis. As one example, suppose your opponent enters the game with a .750 winning percentage and you beat this opponent. The previous value of your &quot;temperature&quot; is then multiplied by 1.750; this is a bigger increase than if you beat a .600 team (which would result in a multiplier of 1.600). Conversely, losing to a .400 teams requires you to multiply your previous temperature by .400, cutting value by more than half (e.g., a previous value of 10 would become 4). Losing to a .800 team, in contrast, doesn&#39;t hurt as much (multiplying the previous value by .800).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In order for a win and a loss to cancel each other out and return a team to the neutral point of 1.00, a more dramatic win, such as beating a .750 team, would be offset by losing to a not-quite-as-good team, in this case with a pre-game .571 win percentage, and vice-versa (1.750 x .571 = 1.00, within rounding). The following graph provides a general characterization of the relationship between win and loss multipliers in order to restore a team to 1.00 (neutrality), plus another example.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z_MuXtCWKCM/VTQY1Nmv5oI/AAAAAAAAC6Q/w1GLcvKMqLM/s1600/temperature%2Bxy%2Bcurve.pptx.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-z_MuXtCWKCM/VTQY1Nmv5oI/AAAAAAAAC6Q/w1GLcvKMqLM/s1600/temperature%2Bxy%2Bcurve.pptx.jpg&quot; height=&quot;312&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Enough formulas, let&#39;s get to some basketball! First, we see the Spurs&#39; hotness for the final 10 games of each of the past four regular seasons (I think you&#39;ll need to click on this chart!).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nEJmE-zNIJY/VTQZWIHI_TI/AAAAAAAAC6Y/Wx9VzGH-4Ts/s1600/spurs%2Btemperatures.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-nEJmE-zNIJY/VTQZWIHI_TI/AAAAAAAAC6Y/Wx9VzGH-4Ts/s1600/spurs%2Btemperatures.jpg&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;San Antonio&#39;s hotness over its last 10 games of the 2014-15 season is 28.47, obtained by multiplying the automatic start value of 1.00 x 1.685 (for the win over Memphis) x 1.466 (for the win over Miami), and so forth. The season-ending loss to New Orleans (which entered the game with a .543 winning percentage) essentially halved the Spurs&#39; hotness value (i.e., multiplying by .543) in one fell swoop.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that the Spurs&#39; hotness was right around the neutral point of 1.00 in both 2013-14, when they won the NBA championship, and in 2012-13, when only a &lt;a href=&quot;http://probasketballtalk.nbcsports.com/2013/06/19/breaking-down-the-heats-game-6-comeback-over-spurs/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;statistically unlikely comeback&lt;/a&gt; by Miami in Game 6 of the finals prevented a San Antonio title, suggests hotness over the final 10 games is not important.Similar findings have been &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hardballtimes.com/ten-things-about-momentum-in-the-postseason/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;obtained for baseball&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the lockout-shortened 2011-12 season, however, the Spurs followed up their 10-game winning streak to end the regular season (hotness = 46.75) with &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/sa/year/2012/san-antonio-spurs&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;10 straight wins to begin the playoffs&lt;/a&gt;, before being eliminated. San Antonio didn&#39;t win the title in 2011-12, but a &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=320531025&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;20-game winning streak&lt;/a&gt; spanning the regular season and playoffs is pretty good!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s look at some other teams that were hot over their final 10 regular-season games in recent years.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-J1YCr7dVLlk/VTQfRHRp3kI/AAAAAAAAC6o/koj7g7RXKnY/s1600/other%2Bnba%2Btemperatures.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-J1YCr7dVLlk/VTQfRHRp3kI/AAAAAAAAC6o/koj7g7RXKnY/s1600/other%2Bnba%2Btemperatures.jpg&quot; height=&quot;171&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As shown in the top row, the Spurs&#39; opponent in the opening round of this year&#39;s playoffs (getting underway tonight), the Los Angeles Clippers, are pretty hot at the moment, too. Both teams are 9-1 over their final 10 regular-season games, but San Antonio (28.47) is hotter than L.A. (18.47), due to the Spurs&#39; higher-quality opposition. For what it&#39;s worth, however, the Clippers&#39; 18.47 hotness exceeds the 2012-13 NBA champion Miami Heat&#39;s 15.14 in also going 9-1 over its final 10 regular-season games (second row).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at teams with 8-2 records over their final 10 regular-season games this year, the Golden State Warriors, who had far-and-away the NBA&#39;s best record (67-15), had a hotness value of 9.76 (third row), and the Boston Celtics, who needed a feverish run just to make the playoffs, had a hotness of 9.65 (last row).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I noted above, other factors could be added to the mix. Perhaps a team&#39;s hotness could be multiplied by bonus adjustment factors of 1.05 or 1.10 (or something else) for each road win or blowout win, or could be multiplied by a deflationary factor of .95 or .90 for a home loss. Recency of performance, which I don&#39;t think was a big issue here due to the focus just on teams&#39; final 10 games, could also be taken into account by multiplying newer wins by greater enhancement factors than older wins. Finally, teams&#39; records toward the end of the regular season can be misleading due to resting of players. That&#39;s another factor for which adjustments would be helpful. Please share any ideas you have for further refinements, in the Comments section.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/3915155194450086196/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=3915155194450086196&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3915155194450086196'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3915155194450086196'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2015/04/spurs-hotness-entering-nba-playoffs.html' title='Spurs&#39; &quot;Hotness&quot; Entering NBA Playoffs'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0-Xo_MTAoaw/VTQSYa_RkvI/AAAAAAAAC6A/Jg4ZL6S1O9Q/s72-c/streak%2Btemperature%2Bschematic.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-339928201819809657</id><published>2015-04-15T12:49:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2015-04-16T10:24:53.394-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Korver Faces Tough Odds to Reach 50/50/90 Level</title><content type='html'>The Atlanta Hawks&#39; Kyle Korver should be familiar to aficionados of hot shooting. The 6-foot-7 shooting guard once had a streak, spanning the 2012-13 and 2013-14 seasons, of making at least one three-pointer in a record &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/eye-on-basketball/24470346/kyle-korvers-3-point-streak-ends-at-127-games&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;127 straight games&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;(I analyzed Korver&#39;s streak &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/12/kyle-korver-approaches-100-straight.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, when it was at 98 games).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During the 2014-15 season, Korver has sought out further frontiers of shooting accuracy. As Ian Levy pointed out back on February 13, Korver was &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/kyle-korver-is-on-pace-for-the-best-nba-shooting-season-of-all-time/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;threatening to record the unprecedented feat&lt;/a&gt; of hitting 50 percent on all shots from the field, 50 percent from three-point land, and 90 percent on free throws, a so-called 50/50/90 season.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Hawks enter their regular-season finale tonight at Chicago, Korver is slightly below all three milestone levels, with a .487 field-goal percentage, .493 three-point percentage, and .897 free-throw percentage (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/2011/kyle-korver&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Korver stats page&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s not even clear how much -- if at all -- Korver will play tonight, as the Hawks &lt;a href=&quot;http://fantasynews.cbssports.com/fantasybasketball/update/25146490/hawks-resting-jeff-teague-kyle-korver-demarre-carroll-al-horford&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rested Korver&lt;/a&gt; and other key players last Sunday at Washington, although he played 34 minutes Monday vs. New York. However, assuming he plays tonight, what kind of shooting numbers will he need to post to reach each of the three criteria?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I plotted some equations for how many shots &lt;i&gt;without a miss&lt;/i&gt; Korver would need to make to reach .500 on overall field goals and treys, and .900 on free throws. Even if Korver missed a shot of a given type, it would be mathematically possible for him to still reach the milestone, but far more makes and attempts would be necessary than if he never missed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s take three-point shooting, where he enters the game 219 out of 444 (.493). Assuming no missed shots, the number of attempts is equal to the number of makes. We can thus define the equation:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; = (219 + &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;) / (444 + &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;where &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; represents Korver&#39;s three-point shooting percentage and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; represents each new attempt (which is always made). In other words, each new attempt raises his number of attempts beyond the current 444 and each new make raises his number of makes beyond the current 219. By how many attempts (and makes) must &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; rise to bring &lt;i&gt;y&lt;/i&gt; to .500? One can type an equation, such as the one above, into Google, which will automatically generate a plot. Here are the resulting plots for Korver in all three shooting categories (you may click on the graphic to enlarge it).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sz8ri7bQjHk/VS65Zh9An_I/AAAAAAAAC5U/mKPClCyhvqs/s1600/kyle%2Bkorver%2B50_50_90.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sz8ri7bQjHk/VS65Zh9An_I/AAAAAAAAC5U/mKPClCyhvqs/s1600/kyle%2Bkorver%2B50_50_90.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We see in the upper-right graph that Korver&#39;s three-point shooting line (blue upward trend) crosses the .500 threshold (black horizontal line) at six attempts. Six more made threes (again, without a miss) would give him 225, which would be half the new number of attempts, 450. Alternatively, Korver could hit the .500 threshold with a 7-of-8 performance behind the arc, resulting in (226/452). As I said, each miss progressively increases the number of shots he would need to make. &amp;nbsp;Making 6-of-6 on threes is not terribly likely. Given that his three-point percentage is very close to 50%, let&#39;s imagine coin-tossing. Korver would have to flip heads six times in a row, which has a probability of 1-in-64.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finishing at .900 on free throws should be relatively easy. Korver just needs to make at least three free throws without a miss. If he&#39;s not perfect, he would have to make 12 of 13 to reach .900 (117/130).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, we have overall field-goal percentage. To reach .500, Korver would need a 16-for-16 night (resulting in 305/610) or, alternatively, 17-of-18 (306/612).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, Korver has his work cut out for him. At the college level, Christian Laettner&#39;s performance against Kentucky in the 1992 regional final comes to mind; not only did he hit the turnaround buzzer-beater, but he also hit &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bigbluehistory.net/bb/statistics/Games/19920328Duke.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;10-of-10 from the floor&lt;/a&gt; and 10-of-10 from the stripe. Also, Bill Walton hit on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/03.26b.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;21-of-22 field goals&lt;/a&gt; in the 1973 final. That&#39;s the kind of game Korver&#39;s looking at.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Korver went 3-of-6 from the floor at Chicago to finish the regular season with a .487 field-goal percentage; 2-of-5 on three-pointers for a final percentage of .492 beyond the arc; and 1-of-1 from the free-throw line to finish at .898 from the stripe (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400579509&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;box score&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/player/stats/_/id/2011/kyle-korver&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;final regular-season statistics&lt;/a&gt;).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/339928201819809657/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=339928201819809657&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/339928201819809657'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/339928201819809657'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2015/04/korver-faces-tough-odds-to-reach-505090.html' title='Korver Faces Tough Odds to Reach 50/50/90 Level'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-sz8ri7bQjHk/VS65Zh9An_I/AAAAAAAAC5U/mKPClCyhvqs/s72-c/kyle%2Bkorver%2B50_50_90.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-5116354024077494078</id><published>2015-01-31T09:36:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2015-01-31T09:53:47.733-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Serena Beats Sharapova 16th Straight Time, Wins Australian Open (with Updated Grand Slam/Age Chart)</title><content type='html'>Serena Williams defeated Maria Sharapova, 6-3, 7-6, in the Australian Open final, giving Williams her &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serena_Williams&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;19th Grand Slam singles title&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/tennis/aus15/story/_/id/12257701/serena-williams-wins-6th-australian-open&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;16th straight win&lt;/a&gt; over Sharapova in their head-to-head rivalry.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back in 2013, on the eve of the French Open women&#39;s singles final (which Williams won, to increase her winning streak at the time to 31 matches), I created a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/06/serena-williamss-tennis-winning-streak.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;chart of Grand Slam singles titles by age&lt;/a&gt; for several women&#39;s greats of the modern era: Serena and Venus Williams, Steffi Graf, Martina Navratilova, Chris Evert, Billie Jean King, and Margaret Court.

Because the Australian Open has shifted in the past between November-December at the end of the year and January at the beginning of the year, seeing the year associated with the Australian Open is ambiguous at first glance. Examining the dates of each year&#39;s Australian Open during Navratilova&#39;s career, relative to her birthday, yielded some slight modifications as reflected above.)&lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/5116354024077494078/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=5116354024077494078&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/5116354024077494078'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/5116354024077494078'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2015/01/serena-williams-beats-maria-sharapova.html' title='Serena Beats Sharapova 16th Straight Time, Wins Australian Open (with Updated Grand Slam/Age Chart)'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cxxU60CeG6A/VM0QzRH1tKI/AAAAAAAAC0s/j16-oioaZW0/s72-c/updated%2Bs%2Bwilliams%2B2015%2Baus.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-8167450539389827876</id><published>2015-01-24T12:42:00.004-08:00</published><updated>2015-01-24T12:45:24.190-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Greatest Shooting Quarter in NBA History: Klay Thompson</title><content type='html'>The Golden State Warriors&#39; Klay Thompson last night had what I think can fairly be called the greatest single quarter of NBA shooting &lt;i&gt;ever&lt;/i&gt;, as his team routed the visiting Sacramento Kings, 126-101. It&#39;s not just that Thompson&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400578943&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;set the Association record&lt;/a&gt; for most points in a quarter -- 37 in the third -- but &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; he did it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He simply didn&#39;t miss. He hit all 9 three-pointers he tried, all 4 two-pointers, and both free throws. Based on this &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=400578943&amp;amp;period=3&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;play-by-play sheet&lt;/a&gt; of the third quarter, I&#39;ve graphed Thompson&#39;s shot sequence according to time left in the third quarter.

Further, he scored 29 of the 37 points from the 6:03 mark in. Twenty-nine points in (roughly) six minutes would translate to 232 points in a 48-minute game! For the record, Thompson scored &quot;only&quot; 52 points on the night (including 11-of-15 from behind the arc). There were two short stretches (5:31, 4:56, and 4:18; 1:06 and 0:35) in which he was hitting a three approximately every 30 seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thompson entered the game with a three-point shooting percentage of .444 this season. The probability of a 9-for-9 quarter shooting threes would be .444 raised to the 9th power, which is .0007 or 7-in-10,000. However, we are asking this question after the fact, knowing the probability is likely to be very low. Using this &lt;a href=&quot;http://vassarstats.net/binomialX.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;binomial calculator&lt;/a&gt;, we can also examine the less extreme (although still post hoc) question of how likely a .444 shooter would be to hit 11 (or more) out of 15 three-point attempts in a game. The answer is .02 or 1-in-50.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/8167450539389827876/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=8167450539389827876&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8167450539389827876'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8167450539389827876'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2015/01/greatest-shooting-quarter-in-nba.html' title='Greatest Shooting Quarter in NBA History: Klay Thompson'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MtsbkGFVxRc/VMP8gZhJ0eI/AAAAAAAAC0c/6YPOOzM-t-s/s72-c/klay%2Bthompson.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-7467797534634583881</id><published>2015-01-13T18:29:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2015-01-13T19:00:43.600-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Hot-Shooting Guards Lead NC St. Over Previously Unbeaten Duke</title><content type='html'>One of the biggest upsets of the current men&#39;s college basketball season occurred this past Sunday, as unranked North Carolina State handed No. 2 Duke &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=400587912&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;its first loss&lt;/a&gt;, 87-75. Key to the Wolfpack&#39;s win was the three-point shooting of two upper-year guards, senior Ralston Turner and junior Trevor Lacey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turner hit three three-pointers in a little over two minutes (between 16:58-14:48) during the second half, to help NC State maintain a narrow lead. A bit later, Lacey hit a couple of threes and a two during a 22-5 run as the Wolfpack expanded a 50-48 lead to a 72-53 advantage (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/playbyplay?gameId=400587912&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;play-by-play sheet&lt;/a&gt;). Duke rallied some, but couldn&#39;t catch up.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Turner ended up 4-of-7 from behind the arc during the day, whereas Lacey went 5-of-7. As it turns out, these guards&#39; long-range success has been building over the past month. In the following graph, I show Turner and Lacey&#39;s three-point shooting percentage game-by-game this season, with the larger basketball data-points (orange for Turner, red for Lacey) reflecting greater numbers of three-point attempts in a given game. You may click on the graph to enlarge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vCWsRfKonoE/VLXMoIKxEmI/AAAAAAAACz8/uWG3UuEehMU/s1600/nc%2Bst.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vCWsRfKonoE/VLXMoIKxEmI/AAAAAAAACz8/uWG3UuEehMU/s1600/nc%2Bst.jpg&quot; height=&quot;288&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The graph should be read from bottom to top, in thin slices. In the Wolfpack&#39;s season-opener against Jackson State (JSU), for example, Turner shot 1-of-4 (.250) from behind the arc, whereas Lacey shot 3-of-5 (.600).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you&#39;re an NC State fan, what you want to see are large-sized basketball icons high up in the graph, meaning that a player launches a lot of three-point attempts and &lt;i&gt;makes a healthy share of them&lt;/i&gt;. Turner has indeed provided several large orange basketballs, shown in the shaded area representing shooting percentages between .400-.700. Against Tennessee, in fact, Turner made eight treys on an amazing 17 attempts, a .471 clip (click here for Turner&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/player/gamelog/_/id/51040/ralston-turner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lacey doesn&#39;t necessarily shoot many threes in a game -- indicated by the relative dearth of large red basketballs -- but when he fires from downtown, he frequently hits. In six of his last eight games, he has shot .500 or better from behind the arc (click here for Lacey&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/player/gamelog/_/id/57174/trevor-lacey&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two additional trends are worth noting. First, for the past month, cold-shooting games have been very rare for Turner and Lacey (see the blue notation on the graph). Second, the two players&#39; shooting accuracy from game to game appears to be correlated. The good news is that, if one of them is shooting well in a game, the other tends to be, also. The bad news, however, is that if one is shooting poorly, so is the other likely to be. For those with some statistical training, the Pearson correlation between Turner and Lacey&#39;s three-point shooting percentage is .45 (where 1.00 is the maximum).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It&#39;s possible a sort of &quot;contagion&quot; operates between Turner and Lacey, where one player&#39;s shooting level in a game (good or bad) rubs off on the other. Another possible explanation is that good defensive teams shut down both Turner and Lacey, and bad ones let both of them shoot the deep ball well.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/7467797534634583881/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=7467797534634583881&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7467797534634583881'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7467797534634583881'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2015/01/hot-shooting-guards-lead-nc-state-men.html' title='Hot-Shooting Guards Lead NC St. Over Previously Unbeaten Duke'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vCWsRfKonoE/VLXMoIKxEmI/AAAAAAAACz8/uWG3UuEehMU/s72-c/nc%2Bst.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-176700952862425920</id><published>2014-12-01T08:59:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2014-12-01T09:01:09.088-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Buy &quot;Hot Hand&quot; Book as a Gift and Get Free Video Dedication</title><content type='html'>From today, Cyber Monday, until December 24, if you &lt;a href=&quot;http://amazon.com/Hot-Hand-Statistics-Greatest-Streaks/dp/1597977136/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;buy the book&lt;/a&gt; &lt;i&gt;Hot Hand&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;as a gift for someone, I will make a short video of myself dedicating the book to your chosen recipient and e-mail you the video, for free.

I took the above photo (on which you can click to enlarge) during the warm-ups. As it turned out, there were at least two streakiness-related developments in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Even though NDSU &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/statistics/team/_/stat/field-goals/sort/fieldGoalPct/year/2014&quot;&gt;led the nation&lt;/a&gt; last season in overall field-goal percentage (.509, based on a .564 percentage on two-point attempts and .367 on three-pointers), there was no carryover into the Texas game. The Bison shot &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=400585674&quot;&gt;.274 on the evening&lt;/a&gt; (.303 inside the arc and .241 on treys). As shown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/playbyplay?gameId=400585674&quot;&gt;play-by-play sheet&lt;/a&gt;, North Dakota State started the game off by missing its first seven field-goal attempts. This season&#39;s annual &lt;i&gt;Sporting News College Basketball Yearbook&lt;/i&gt; points out that NDSU lost its top three scorers from last year, which probably goes a long way in explaining the Bison&#39;s lackluster shooting in Austin.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In contrast, highly touted frosh forward Myles Turner lit things up for the Longhorns. Upon entering the game a few minutes in, he hit three quick jumpers. All in all, Turner hit 6-of-8 from the floor, which combined with 3-of-4 from the stripe, gave him 15 points.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/4589119407871971038/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=4589119407871971038&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4589119407871971038'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4589119407871971038'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2014/11/hot-texas-and-cold-n-dakota-st-shooting.html' title='Hot (Texas) and Cold (N.

Both had intended to play college ball for premier programs (Delle Donne for Connecticut in 2008, and Bird for Indiana in 1974), but left after a short time on campus. Plus, they are both great free-throw shooters.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Bird resurfaced at Indiana State, where he led the Sycamores to the 1979 NCAA championship game. He then had a long and successful pro career with the Boston Celtics, during which he once made &lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/1990-02-14/sports/sp-656_1_free-throw-record&quot;&gt;71 straight free throws&lt;/a&gt;, seven short of the NBA record at the time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Delle Donne likewise returned to collegiate competition, in her case with Delaware. According to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.luckyshow.org/basketball/straightFTs.htm&quot;&gt;webpage&lt;/a&gt;, which catalogs consecutive-free throw records at different levels of competition, Delle Donne is tied for the ninth-longest streak of made free throws in women&#39;s NCAA Division I history, at 52. She also once made 80 straight from the stripe in high school, one of the longest streaks at that level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;This summer, Delle Donne hit 50 straight free throws for Chicago, giving her stretches of 50 (or more) straight at three levels of play (high school, college, and pro). I don&#39;t know how many other players -- male or female -- have achieved this feat, but I doubt there are too many. (According to the free-throw records website, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._J._Redick&quot;&gt;J.J. Redick&lt;/a&gt; of the L.A. Clippers has exceeded 50 straight in high school and college; perhaps one day he&#39;ll reach that mark in the NBA.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to Delle Donne, her &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wnba.com/playerfile/elena_delle_donne/game_by_game_stats.html&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt; documents how she hit 50 straight free throws during the current WNBA season. On May 21, she hit 5-of-6 from the stripe; according to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wnba.com/games/20140521/CONCHI/gameinfo.html#wnbaGIboxscore&quot;&gt;play-by-play sheet&lt;/a&gt;, her lone miss occurred on her second attempt, meaning that she made her last &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;four&lt;/span&gt; free throws in that game. Her next several games featured free-throw statistics of &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;9-9, 0-0, 8-8, 16-16&lt;/span&gt; (a WNBA &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/wnba/story/_/id/11293729/wnba-chicago-sky-elena-delle-donne-savors-return-court&quot;&gt;single-game record&lt;/a&gt;), &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;0-0, 7-7, and 3-3&lt;/span&gt;. It wasn&#39;t until August 3 that Delle Donne missed again. As shown in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wnba.com/games/20140803/WASCHI/gameinfo.html#wnbaGIboxscore&quot;&gt;play-by-play&lt;/a&gt; for this game, she made her first &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;three&lt;/span&gt; free-throw attempts, missed, and then made another, for a 4-5 night. Adding up the numbers of made free throws shown in red, you get 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The WNBA record for consecutive made free throws is 66, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basketball-reference.com/wnba/players/n/nemcoev01w.html&quot;&gt;Eva Nemcova&lt;/a&gt; of the now-defunct Cleveland Rockers, spanning the 1999 and 2000 seasons. With Delle Donne&#39;s streak of 50 straight free throws having ended, she&#39;ll have to mount a new challenge to break Nemcova&#39;s record of 66; I wouldn&#39;t bet against it!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/2570760474263436498/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=2570760474263436498&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2570760474263436498'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2570760474263436498'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2014/08/elena-delle-donnes-free-throw-streaks.html' title='Elena Delle Donne&#39;s Free Throw Streaks'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-2650903259779126458</id><published>2014-06-18T07:10:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2014-06-18T07:13:28.184-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Spurs&#39; Record Hot Shooting Lifts Them to NBA Title</title><content type='html'>As all NBA basketball fans undoubtedly know by now, the San Antonio Spurs are this year&#39;s champions, having dispatched of the two-time defending champion Miami Heat in five games. Red-hot shooting was the story for the Spurs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Heat looked poised to capture a road victory in Game 1, leading 86-79 with 9:37 left in the fourth. The Spurs then proceeded to hit &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=400559374&amp;amp;period=0&quot;&gt;6-of-6 on three-pointers&lt;/a&gt; (including three by Danny Green) and, before you knew it, San Antonio had won going away, 110-95.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miami won Game 2 by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=400559375&quot;&gt;98-96&lt;/a&gt; score, but that was the Heat&#39;s last hurrah.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Game 3, the Spurs hit &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400559376&quot;&gt;75.8% of their shots&lt;/a&gt; from the field in the first half, an NBA record for a half of a finals game. This shooting exhibition gave San Antonio a 71-50 lead at the break, en route to a 111-92 rout.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Game 4 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=400559377&quot;&gt;107-86&lt;/a&gt;) and Game 5 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=400559378&quot;&gt;104-87&lt;/a&gt;) were likewise blowouts. Miami, feeling great desperation on the brink of elimination, jumped out to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=400559378&quot;&gt;22-6 lead&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;in Game 5.

For those not familiar with the term, under a run rule (also known as a mercy rule), a baseball or softball game will be called off early if one team has built a large enough lead after a specified number of innings. In NCAA softball, where the regulation length of games is seven innings, the run rule will be triggered when one team &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mercy_rule&quot;&gt;leads by at least eight runs after five or six innings&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From 2000-2013, Michigan&#39;s softball program won 10 regular-season B1G titles (nine outright and one tie), made the Women&#39;s College World Series six times, and captured the NCAA national championship in 2005 (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/mich/sports/w-softbl/auto_pdf/2013-14/misc_non_event/sfb-recordbook.pdf&quot;&gt;UM&#39;s softball record book&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Entering Friday night&#39;s game at Illinois, the Wolverines had played &lt;b&gt;270&lt;/b&gt; B1G regular-season conference games (i.e., excluding the conference tourney) since being run-ruled by Northwestern in 2000. In fact, Michigan had lost only 41 conference games during that time, an average of roughly three per season. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With Michigan coming into last night&#39;s game with a 15-2 conference record, compared to Illinois&#39;s 3-14, the occasion would not have seemed ripe for the Wolverines to be run-ruled in a B1G contest for the first time in 14 years and 270 games!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a proud University of Michigan graduate, it pains me to say it, but it happened. The Wolverines were indeed &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mgoblue.com/sports/w-softbl/recaps/042514aab.html&quot;&gt;run-ruled by the Illini&lt;/a&gt;, 10-2 in 6 innings. Credit Illinois with timely hitting in bunches. As the linked game article notes, &quot;Four two-out hits in the bottom of the fourth led to Illinois&#39; three runs. Three doubles in the sixth led to the run-rule decision.&quot; Four Michigan errors didn&#39;t help either.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;*This is the wordmark for the Big Ten Conference. If one reads the &quot;1&quot; like an &quot;I,&quot; it says BIG.

Occasionally this happened, as we discovered. More likely, however, was that a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2014/03/note-to-76ers-fans-losing-streaks.html&quot;&gt;skid would end against very weak opposition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With tonight&#39;s Spurs-Thunder game starting shortly, I have put together a graphic that turns last week&#39;s question on its head. How often does a long winning streak end against poor opposition? Or, does it nearly always take a high-caliber opponent to end a team&#39;s long winning streak? Except for now looking at all-time great NBA winning streaks instead of losing streaks, my methodology today is the same as last week&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What we find in the graph below (on which you can click to enlarge) is that some of the greatest winning streaks, such as the Lakers&#39; record 33-gamer, were ended only when a stellar opponent came up on the schedule. A few times, however, a hot team was embarrassed by an opponent playing at or below a .300 clip!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Time is short, so I&#39;ll end here.

One reason the Wolverines were unable to coast to a blow-out win over the Volunteers was a drop in Michigan&#39;s three-point shooting percentage from .778 (7-of-9) in the first half to .364 (4-of-11) in the second.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas there could be substantive reasons for the Wolverines&#39; second-half decline from behind the arc (e.g., fatigue, better Tennessee defense), the phenomenon of &lt;i&gt;regression toward the mean&lt;/i&gt; almost certainly contributed, as well. Regression toward the mean refers to performers who exhibit extreme values on a set of initial measurements -- on either the high or low end -- achieving at closer to an average level on later measurements. According to the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.socialresearchmethods.net/kb/regrmean.php&quot;&gt;Social Research Methods&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;website, regression toward the mean:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;will happen anytime you measure two measures! It will happen forwards in time (i.e., from pretest to posttest). It will happen backwards in time (i.e., from posttest to pretest)! It will happen across measures collected at the same time (e.g., height and weight)! It will happen even if you don&#39;t give your program or treatment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using box scores from all of Michigan&#39;s 2013-14 games to date (contained in UM&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/mich/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2013-14/release/release_20140329aaa.pdf&quot;&gt;game notes&lt;/a&gt; in advance of Sunday&#39;s Elite Eight match-up with Kentucky), I plotted the Wolverines&#39; team three-point shooting percentages for each first-half and second-half played this season. Each line in the graph links the two halves of the same game, with the Tennessee game depicted in orange, as one example (there were too many games, 36, to label each line). You may click on the graph to enlarge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n9QW_7ZrSqg/Uzebxm3lqkI/AAAAAAAACqk/5XSsdMux7do/s1600/mich+regression+to+mean.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n9QW_7ZrSqg/Uzebxm3lqkI/AAAAAAAACqk/5XSsdMux7do/s1600/mich+regression+to+mean.jpg&quot; height=&quot;338&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regression to the mean is indicated by lines that slope from very high to the middle, and lines that slope from very low to the middle. Also shown in the graph is Michigan&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/mich/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2013-14/stats/season_stats.pdf&quot;&gt;.402 three-point success rate&lt;/a&gt; for the season to this point. The Wolverines&#39; pattern is a textbook example of regression toward the mean, as can be seen by comparing the above graph to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://davidakenny.net/old/series/primer.htm&quot;&gt;diagram from a textbook&lt;/a&gt; (Campbell and Kenny&#39;s &lt;i&gt;A Primer on Regression Artifacts&lt;/i&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When Michigan (or any team) hits close to 80% of its treys in a half of one game, it is unlikely that it can match or exceed that rate in the other half. It is also true that a team shooting .100 or worse for a half will rarely* match or drop below that level in the other half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted above, regression to the mean is virtually certain to occur anytime multiple measurements are obtained. The above depiction for Michigan is probably more dramatic than would be the case for most other teams, as most teams presumably are not as capable as the Wolverines of exceeding three-point shooting percentages of .600 or .700 within a half. Out of 351 NCAA Division I men&#39;s basketball teams, Michigan finished the regular season &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/statistics/team/_/stat/3-points/sort/threePointFieldGoalPct/seasontype/2&quot;&gt;tied for seventh nationally&lt;/a&gt; in three-point shooting percentage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;*I inadvertently omitted the word &quot;rarely&quot; from the original version of this posting.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/8340373804366514847/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=8340373804366514847&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8340373804366514847'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8340373804366514847'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2014/03/michigans-3pt-shooting-illustration-of.html' title='Michigan&#39;s 3PT Shooting: An Illustration of Regression to the Mean'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-n9QW_7ZrSqg/Uzebxm3lqkI/AAAAAAAACqk/5XSsdMux7do/s72-c/mich+regression+to+mean.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-79546918498387563</id><published>2014-03-27T16:25:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2014-03-29T21:48:10.769-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Note to 76ers&#39; Fans: Losing Streaks Usually End Against Bad Teams</title><content type='html'>With college basketball&#39;s March Madness dominating the U.S. hoops scene, it may have escaped some that the Philadelphia 76ers are on the verge of tying and possibly breaking the NBA record for longest losing streak. As shown on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_longest_losing_streaks&quot;&gt;Wikipedia&#39;s list of the longest NBA losing streaks&lt;/a&gt;, Philadelphia has been &quot;deep-sixed&quot; 25 straight times during its current streak, one loss shy of the record 26 consecutive defeats suffered by the 2010–11 Cleveland Cavaliers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A record-tying 26th straight loss likely awaits the Sixers tonight at Houston. Even the disparity in the teams&#39; records this season --&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/team/_/name/hou/houston-rockets&quot;&gt; 48-22 for the Rockets, compared to 15-56 for Philly&lt;/a&gt; -- probably doesn&#39;t capture the full difference in the teams&#39; abilities. After all, the Western Conference, in which Houston plays, has been much tougher this year than the Eastern Conference, in which the Sixers play, and teams play most of their games within conference. Also, after Philly recently traded Evan Turner, one of its better players, an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.examiner.com/article/evan-turner-traded-to-pacers-for-danny-granger&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; from Examiner.com contended that:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;On paper this is a bad deal for the Sixers, but they have no intention on trying to win games. The team is tanking like no other in hopes of winning the 2014 NBA Draft Lottery. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Getting back to tonight&#39;s game, Carl Bialik, the former &lt;i&gt;Wall Street Journal&lt;/i&gt; &quot;Numbers Guy&quot; who now writes for the newly relaunched FiveThirtyEight, calculates only a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/even-if-they-dont-win-tonight-the-76ers-are-getting-better/&quot;&gt;4% chance of the 76ers winning&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Sixers&#39; losing streak was building in recent weeks, I began trying to come up with a statistical angle on it. One line of thinking is that, contrary to the idea of other teams taking the struggling team lightly, opponents will play even harder against a team in free-fall in an attempt to avoid being &quot;that team&quot; -- the one against whom the losing streak ended. Thus, for Philly, ending its losing streak against a strong team such as Houston, on the road no less, would seem unlikely.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The question then came to me: what is the profile of an opposing squad against which a team ends its long losing streak? Presumably, such an opponent is likely to be a bad team. If you lose to a team that has lost its last 20 or 25 games, you can&#39;t be that good yourself. Ultimately, though, it&#39;s an empirical question.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I consulted the aforementioned Wikipedia list of the longest losing streaks in NBA history. The list included 30 losing streaks: one each of 26, 25, and 24 straight losses, three of length 23, one of 21 games, four of length 20, seven of length 19, four of length 18, and eight 17-game losing streaks. The list also included the date and opponent when the streak ended. I then went to Basketball Reference, which has extensive season logs for &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/&quot;&gt;all teams in NBA history&lt;/a&gt;. For example, seeing on the Wikipedia list that the 2010-11 Cleveland Cavaliers (holder of the league record) ended their 26-game losing streak on February 11, 2011 against the L.A. Clippers, I could go to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAC/2011_games.html&quot;&gt;Clippers&#39; log&lt;/a&gt; for that season and see that they brought a 20-32 (.385) record into the game with the Cavs. Taking advantage of this weak opposition, Cleveland ended its losing streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I tried to make the same inquiry into the ending of all 30 of the NBA&#39;s longest losing streaks. However, streaks that carried over from one season to the next often ended early the next season, when teams may have played only a few games. To ensure relatively large samples of games, therefore, I limited my analysis to situations in which teams against whom a long losing streak ended had played at least 20 games during the season. There were 18 such situations, which I depict in the following graph. Unless you have some unbelievably strong eyesight, you&#39;ll want to click on the graphic to enlarge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-exLhTuWCZq0/UzSs1m7kUKI/AAAAAAAACqU/cknAn4f9XUg/s1600/nba+losing+streaks.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-exLhTuWCZq0/UzSs1m7kUKI/AAAAAAAACqU/cknAn4f9XUg/s1600/nba+losing+streaks.jpg&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The data points, represented by little basketballs, are arranged left-to-right from lowest to highest opponents&#39; winning percentages entering games in which long losing streaks ended. A description of each streak-ending appears vertically by each ball. On the far left, the game in question is one in which the 1997-98 Denver Nuggets ended their 23-game losing streak by beating a 10-32 (.238) Clippers outfit. In another seven games, a team ended a long losing streak by beating a team whose winning percentage was in the .300&#39;s entering the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrary to my expectation that most games to end long losing streaks would have featured a really weak opposing team, seven of the games featured opponents with incoming winning percentages from .483-.614. And, most surprising of all, in three games, teams ended their long losing streaks against top-quality opposition (depicted in blue text on the graphic):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 1964-65 then-San Francisco Warriors ended their 17-game losing streak by beating the 34-16 (.680) Cincinnati Royals (now the Sacramento Kings).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 1972-73 Sixers, a squad that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/PHI/1973_games.html&quot;&gt;won only nine games all season&lt;/a&gt;, snapped their 20-game losing streak by beating the 42-18 (.700) Milwaukee Bucks. This was during the Kareem Abdul-Jabbar era in Milwaukee, in which the Bucks &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/MIL/&quot;&gt;won the 1971 NBA title and lost a seven-game final in 1974&lt;/a&gt;. Kareem did miss the fourth quarter of the Sixers&#39; streak-busting game, due to a back injury.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The 1967-68 then-San Diego Rockets ended their 17-game losing streak by beating the 48-16 (.750) 76ers. This was toward the end of Wilt Chamberlain&#39;s time in Philly, with the Sixers having&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Season-76ers-Chamberlain-Champion-Philadelphia-ebook/dp/B000FA5S2U/&quot;&gt; won the 1967 NBA title&lt;/a&gt;. &amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;So yes, there is some precedent for teams ending their long losing streaks against opposing teams with winning percentages in the vicinity of .700. Perhaps you noticed another pattern, though. All three instances of teams ending their losing streaks against such lofty opposition occurred more than 40 years ago! It may be just a coincidence. However, another possibility is that the greater scrutiny of sports contests now than in the past (e.g., via the Internet, 24-hour sports cable networks, and radio talk shows) has made the top teams extra sensitive to becoming &quot;that team&quot; when they face an opponent on a long losing streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; After losing to Houston to &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=400489945&quot;&gt;tie the NBA record&lt;/a&gt; of 26 straight losses, the 76ers &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400489960&quot;&gt;beat Detroit&lt;/a&gt; to end the streak.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/79546918498387563/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=79546918498387563&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/79546918498387563'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/79546918498387563'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2014/03/note-to-76ers-fans-losing-streaks.html' title='Note to 76ers&#39; Fans: Losing Streaks Usually End Against Bad Teams'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-exLhTuWCZq0/UzSs1m7kUKI/AAAAAAAACqU/cknAn4f9XUg/s72-c/nba+losing+streaks.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-4818431168171953100</id><published>2014-03-14T07:53:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2014-03-14T10:37:46.644-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Team Scoring Runs in College Basketball -- Revisited</title><content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;ESPN The Magazine&lt;/i&gt;&#39;s annual &quot;Analytics Issue&quot; (March 3, 2014) includes an &lt;a href=&quot;http://insider.espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/10476177/long-beach-state-49ers-scoring-streak-result-motivation-not-momentum-espn-magazine&quot;&gt;article by Ken Pomeroy&lt;/a&gt; on when team scoring runs are most likely to occur in college basketball. Pomeroy focuses on runs of at least 10-0 (i.e., one team scoring 10 straight points without any scoring by the opponent), although other analysts might differ either on the minimum number of points by the &quot;hot&quot; team needed to constitute a run or on whether the shutout element is necessary for a run (i.e., some would consider outscoring a team by a margin of 15-2, for example, during a stretch to be a run).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using the 10-0 criterion and voluminous data from recent seasons, Pomeroy examined, among other things, the probability of teams going on a run, depending on whether they were winning or losing (and by how much) or tied. He found small, but steady, differences, comprising an unmistakable trend. The more a team was behind, the higher its probability of going on a 10-0 run, and the more a team was ahead, the smaller its probability. A team trailing by 10 points had approximately a 1.86% chance of going on such a run, a team trailing by 9 points had roughly a 1.76% chance, a team 8 points behind had roughly a 1.72% chance, and so forth (the reason these percentages are approximate is that the exact values are not listed and I am estimating them visually from the heights of bars on a graph). In a tie game, a team has about a 1.24% chance of a 10-0 run. A team with a 1-point lead had around a 1.20% chance, one with a 2-point lead had roughly a 1.16% chance, and so forth. Finally, a team up 10 had approximately a 0.88% chance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my 2012 book &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Hot-Hand-Statistics-Greatest-Streaks/dp/1597977136/&quot;&gt;Hot Hand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, I also examined team runs, in this case in the 2004 NCAA men&#39;s basketball tournament. My aim at the time was simply to document the number of runs in the tourney, using the criterion of a 10-point margin, but not requiring a shutout during the run. A margin such as 12-2 or 16-3 would have sufficed, for example. As I wrote in the book, &quot;Nearly three-quarters of the games (47 out of 64) featured at least one major run&quot; (p. 27). Many of the games included multiple runs, so the number of total runs was 67. Unlike Pomeroy, I did not initially seek to correlate the occurrence of runs with whether the team that went on the run was ahead or behind (and by how much) at the time of the run. However, play-by-play sheets from the 2004 tournament are still available online (by going to a given team&#39;s schedule page at ESPN.com, as in &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/schedule/_/id/2641/texas-tech-red-raiders&quot;&gt;this example&lt;/a&gt;, and then selecting 2003-04). Thus, I could go back and try to replicate Pomeroy&#39;s analysis.*&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas my horizontal axis was structured the same as Pomeroy&#39;s, depicting how many points behind (negative values) or ahead (positive values) a team was right before launching its run, I used a different measure of run intensity on the vertical axis. As I noted above, he looked at probability of a 10-0 run. Instead, I plotted the margin of a given run (e.g., outscoring an opponent 16-3 during a run would be recorded as +13). The graph appears below, the background ranging left-to-right from darker red for larger deficits to darker green for larger leads. You may click on the graph to enlarge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rGM5eMZ1KyE/UyJxqiEkyoI/AAAAAAAACpc/upTdrkzsJ2c/s1600/team+runs.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rGM5eMZ1KyE/UyJxqiEkyoI/AAAAAAAACpc/upTdrkzsJ2c/s1600/team+runs.jpg&quot; height=&quot;361&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each dot represents a particular scoring run. Three of the dots are annotated to provide examples of what all the dots represent. The downward-trending line, known as the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.strath.ac.uk/aer/materials/4dataanalysisineducationalresearch/unit4/ordinaryleastsquaresmethod/&quot;&gt;best-fit line&lt;/a&gt; because it is close to as many of the dots as possible, shows the same pattern as Pomeroy&#39;s findings. The further behind a team was, the greater its tendency to outscore the opponent by a huge margin. For those of you with some statistical training, the correlation between initial deficit/lead and margin of outscoring the opponent during the run was &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;  = -.24, on the cusp of statistical significance at&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;  = .051.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Teams that were way ahead rarely went on a big scoring run. One exception, noted in the graph, is that Kansas, already leading 85-64, went on a &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/playbyplay?gameId=244000053&quot;&gt;12-0 run&lt;/a&gt; against the University of Alabama-Birmingham to expand the Jayhawks&#39; lead to 97-64. One reason teams with big leads rarely go on new scoring runs presumably is that they often take out their top players, both to rest them and to avoid the appearance of &quot;running up the score&quot; on the opponent.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A second, more statistically based reason for why trailing teams are more likely than leading teams to go on runs is the concept of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_toward_the_mean&quot;&gt;regression toward the mean&lt;/a&gt;. Regression toward the mean tells us that, even absent any intervention, both extreme low performers (i.e., the trailing team) and extreme high performers (i.e., the leading team) tend to return toward more average performances. An extreme low performer has nowhere to go but up, and an extreme high performer has nowhere to go but down.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In conclusion, Pomeroy&#39;s and my investigations are very clear that trailing teams are far more likely to go on scoring runs than are leading teams. Psychological factors suggested by Pomeroy (e.g., motivation on the part of the trailing team and the desire to conserve energy by the leading team) and regression toward the mean are likely explanations of the basic finding, but it is difficult to know the relative importance of the two explanations.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;---&lt;br /&gt;*In revisiting the play-by-play sheets from the 2004 NCAA tournament, I noticed a few slight discrepancies with what appeared in my book. For example, a &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=244000027&quot;&gt;game article&lt;/a&gt; on the Mississippi State-Monmouth contest stated that, &quot;The 15th-seeded [Monmouth] Hawks shot their way within four points late in the first half, but Mississippi State pulled away by controlling both ends of the floor. The Bulldogs tore off a 22-5 run in less than 10 minutes, and cruised to their largest margin of victory of the season.&quot; Based on the game article, I listed Mississippi State&#39;s run as 22-5 in my book. However, the article&#39;s qualifier &quot;in less than 10 minutes&quot; was more important than I realized at the time. If one looks at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/playbyplay?gameId=244000027&quot;&gt;play-by-play sheet&lt;/a&gt;, one sees that Mississippi State indeed outscored Monmouth 22-5 in the roughly 10:00 window of time from 4:47 left in the first half (MSU up 36-32) to 15:23 left in the second half (MSU up 58-37). However, what I did not notice until revisiting the play-by-play sheet for today&#39;s analysis is that &lt;i&gt;Mississippi State added 6 more unanswered points beyond the 10-minute window&lt;/i&gt;, making the full run really 28-5.Small discrepancies such as this were corrected for today&#39;s analysis.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/4818431168171953100/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=4818431168171953100&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4818431168171953100'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4818431168171953100'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2014/03/team-scoring-runs-in-college-basketball.html' title='Team Scoring Runs in College Basketball -- Revisited'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-rGM5eMZ1KyE/UyJxqiEkyoI/AAAAAAAACpc/upTdrkzsJ2c/s72-c/team+runs.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-1539831479280983603</id><published>2013-12-28T17:06:00.002-08:00</published><updated>2013-12-29T12:01:43.240-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Kyle Korver Approaches 100 Straight Games with At Least One Made Three-Pointer</title><content type='html'>Kyle Korver, a 6-foot-7 shooting guard for the Atlanta Hawks, has now hit at least one three-point basket in &lt;a href=&quot;http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/wireStory/teagues-clutch-shot-give-hawks-127-125-win-21343999&quot;&gt;98 straight games&lt;/a&gt;, a new record. To reach an even 100, Korver must hit a three tonight at home against Charlotte and Sunday night at Orlando (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/atl/atlanta-hawks&quot;&gt;Hawks&#39; schedule&lt;/a&gt;). As reported in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nba/hawks/2013/11/25/kyle-korver-three-point-record-atlanta-dana-barros/3710719/&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; article&lt;/a&gt; from late November, the previous record was 89 consecutive games with a trey. The Top 5 longest such streaks in NBA history include Korver&#39;s and four that go back to the 1980s and &#39;90s:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kyle Korver 98 (still going)&lt;br /&gt;Dana Barros 89&lt;br /&gt;Michael Adams 79&lt;br /&gt;Dennis Scott 78&lt;br /&gt;Reggie Miller 68&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &quot;at least one&quot; aspect of Korver&#39;s streak brings to mind baseball hitting streaks (i.e., number of games with at least one hit). Let&#39;s refer to a made three-pointer in basketball or a hit in baseball as a &quot;success.&quot; To calculate the probability of a streak of games with at least one success, one needs to know the probability of at least one success in a given game, and to determine that, one must know the probability of a success in a single trial (a shot in basketball or an official at-bat in baseball).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The above-linked &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; article, published when Korver&#39;s streak was at 87 games, noted that he had shot 46.9% (226-for-482) on treys during the streak. Consulting Korver&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/player/gamelog/_/id/2011/kyle-korver&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt; on ESPN.com, we see that he has made an additional 40 treys on 82 attempts in his last 11 games (note that he missed four games between Nov. 27 and Dec. 2 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.peachtreehoops.com/2013/11/27/5152490/kyle-korver-injury-rib-atlanta-hawks&quot;&gt;due to injury&lt;/a&gt;). Thus, the last 11 games have raised Korver&#39;s three-point shooting percentage during the streak to 47.2% or .472 (based on 266/564). We will use Korver&#39;s .472 shooting percentage on threes to represent his probability of success in a single trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;During Joe DiMaggio&#39;s Major League Baseball-record streak of getting at least one hit in 56 consecutive games, set in 1941, his batting average was .409. That would be DiMaggio&#39;s probability of success in a single trial.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The number of trials or opportunities an athlete gets per game is also a crucial factor. In basketball, of course, a player can shoot as often as the coach wants him or her to, whereas in baseball, teams follow a batting order that limits each player to one at-bat for every nine taken by his team. With that distinction between basketball and baseball noted, dividing Korver&#39;s 564 three-point attempts by the 98 games in which they have occurred yields an average of 5.76 attempts per game. DiMaggio averaged 3.98 at-bats per game.* Because Korver has had a higher success rate in his task (making three-point shots) than DiMaggio had at his (getting hits), and because Korver has had more attempts per game than DiMaggio, it is not surprising that the length of Korver&#39;s streak has greatly exceeded DiMaggio&#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To deal in round numbers, let&#39;s say Korver takes six shots per game from behind the arc. With his .472 success rate on treys, his likelihood of &lt;i&gt;missing&lt;/i&gt; any given attempt is 1 - .472, or .528. Korver&#39;s probability of missing all six of his (typical) three-point attempts in a game is then .528 to the 6th power, or .022. Anything other than an all-miss night means at least one made three-pointer. Thus, we take 1 - .022, which yields .978 as Korver&#39;s probability of making at least one shot from downtown in a game. (This formula assumes the outcomes of shots from one attempt to the next are independent of each other, like successive tosses of a coin.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With roughly a 98% chance in each game of making at least one three-pointer (as long as he gets six attempts and has a .472 likelihood of success on each one), it is no wonder that Korver has been able to maintain such a long streak of games with a trey. To complete the calculation of Korver&#39;s probability of hitting at least one three-pointer in 98 consecutive games, we would raise .978 to the 98th power. This yields .113, for a roughly 1-in-9 chance that Korver (or other players whose three-point attempts and shooting percentages are similar to Korver&#39;s) would hit a trey in 98 consecutive games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As discussed in my book &lt;i&gt;Hot Hand&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;(pp. 54-55), researchers David Rockoff and Phil Yates offered the useful reminder to streak analysts that, even though a player &lt;i&gt;averages&lt;/i&gt; a certain number of opportunities per game, he or she may get more opportunities than average or fewer opportunities than average in any particular game. The above calculation for Korver, assuming a consistent six shots per game, may thus have to be taken with a grain of salt.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If, for example, Korver launched only two three-point attempts in a given game, he would not have a 97.8% probability of making at least one three in the game. Instead, we would take his miss rate (.528) and raise it to the second power (corresponding to two shots) to estimate the probability of an all-miss game; the calculation yields .279. With only two shots taken, therefore, Korver would have a 1 - .279, or .721, probability of making at least one trey in the game. That&#39;s still pretty high, but not as near-definitive as .978. With more than six shots in a game, Korver&#39;s probability of making at least one three-pointer would be even higher than .978. With 10 shots, for example, we would take 1 - (.528 to the 10th power), which yields .998.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To explore this issue further, I&#39;ve plotted the number of three-point attempts taken by Korver in each game of his 98-game streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-R64Z_bN6Isk/Ur9vWoG0SqI/AAAAAAAACo8/yZkLUdTuwP8/s1600/korver+3pt+attempts+per+game.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;278&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-R64Z_bN6Isk/Ur9vWoG0SqI/AAAAAAAACo8/yZkLUdTuwP8/s400/korver+3pt+attempts+per+game.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most common scenario (evident in 21 games) is that Korver attempts exactly six treys per game. Games with fewer than six attempts (46 total) are somewhat more common than games with more than six (31). Still, he&#39;s had no games with just one attempt and only five with two attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another interesting question (to me at least) is, how many times has Korver&#39;s streak been in danger? In other words, how many times has he gotten late into a game without a made three? I decided to examine in depth the play-by-play sheets for games in which he ended up with only one made three, of which there were 24 games (roughly a quarter of the games in the streak). In those 24 games, Korver made his lone three:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;10 times in the first quarter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;4 times in the second quarter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 times in the third quarter; and&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;5 times in the fourth quarter.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the five games in which Korver got his lone three-pointer in the fourth quarter, four times there was 5:50 or more left in the game. The closest the streak has come to ending, it appears, was in what became the 54th game of the streak, March 8, 2013 in Boston. On that night, Korver made his only three of the game with just &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=400278637&quot;&gt;1:31 remaining&lt;/a&gt; in the fourth quarter! (It is possible he went deeper into a game with no threes, then make two or more quick ones, although it seems unlikely.

The Pirates&#39; streak of 20 straight losing seasons was the longest such streak in &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2011/09/with-yesterdays-loss-to-st.html&quot;&gt;any of the four major sports leagues&lt;/a&gt; in North America (MLB, NFL, NBA, and NHL).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I created the following graphic to indicate how many wins the Pirates attained from 1993 (the year the string of losing seasons began) to the present. The break-even point of 81 wins is highlighted. Unless you have amazing eyesight, you&#39;ll probably want to click on the graphic to enlarge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fI6zgDDI7MM/Ui81Rr8enzI/AAAAAAAAClk/4jDB1MY2Lkc/s1600/pirate+win+totals.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;332&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-fI6zgDDI7MM/Ui81Rr8enzI/AAAAAAAAClk/4jDB1MY2Lkc/s400/pirate+win+totals.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Congratulations to the Pirates and their fans. Not only has this year&#39;s team ended the franchise&#39;s record streak of losing seasons; it is a virtual cinch to make the playoffs (Pittsburgh&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/standings&quot;&gt;probability of making the playoffs&lt;/a&gt; is currently listed as 98.7% on ESPN&#39;s standings). I like that the Pirates have achieved a winning record relatively early, rather than taking things down to the final days of the season.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/1066896460004358838/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=1066896460004358838&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/1066896460004358838'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/1066896460004358838'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/09/its-official-pirates-achieve-first.html' title='It&#39;s Official!

One criterion for being considered a streaky performer, according to some analysts, is the ability to record hot stretches on repeated occasions. Uehara thus seems able to get &quot;on a roll,&quot; &quot;in the zone,&quot; &quot;on fire,&quot; or any similar term one chooses.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The records for consecutive batters retired by a pitcher are 45 by Mark Buehrle (for a starter) and 41 by Bobby Jenks (for a reliever). Uehara still has a way to go to catch these marks. However, having separate streaks of 25 and (at least) 27, as Uehara has done, is extremely impressive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: blue;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE 1:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Bob Timmermann informed me that, &quot;Kenley Jansen of the Dodgers also retired 27 straight batters this year from July 23 to August 8.&quot; Here&#39;s an article on Jansen&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grantland.com/blog/the-triangle/post/_/id/71157/shut-the-door-have-a-seat-kenley-jansen-is-simply-awesome&quot;&gt;background and&amp;nbsp;accomplishments&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;UPDATE 2:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Uehara&#39;s streak reached 37 straight batters retired, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bostonglobe.com/sports/2013/09/17/koji-uehara-streak-consecutive-outs-ends-red-sox-fall-orioles/QDBNeCuAHJ2VutUDWMZJRL/story.html&quot;&gt;until being snapped&lt;/a&gt; in a September 17 game against the Baltimore Orioles.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/2678667686116973645/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=2678667686116973645&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2678667686116973645'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2678667686116973645'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/09/red-sox-pitcher-koji-uehara-has-retired.html' title='Red Sox P Koji Uehara Has Retired 27 Straight Batters'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-T1pHhzMesrw/UiqshzvBj3I/AAAAAAAACjM/IaaW0EoL-IA/s72-c/uehara+2013.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-2747718232256200325</id><published>2013-09-03T22:19:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-09-03T22:20:27.463-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Pirates Win 81st, End Streak of 20 Straight Losing Seasons</title><content type='html'>The Pittsburgh Pirates have won again tonight (&lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=330903108&quot;&gt;4-3 at Milwaukee&lt;/a&gt;), bringing their record to 81-57 for the season.

It is truly an &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1737228-how-the-dodgers-pulled-off-mlbs-best-50-game-run-since-the-big-red-machine&quot;&gt;amazing turnaround&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Winning this many -- or more -- times in any 50-game MLB stretch is a very rare occurrence, especially in recent decades. This online &lt;i&gt;Sports Illustrated&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://mlb.si.com/2013/08/12/los-angeles-dodgers-wild-card-era/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; includes charts documenting the all-time best records over 50 (and 45) games.   The all-time best record over 50 contests is held by the 1906 Chicago Cubs at 45-5, followed by the 1912 New York Giants at 43-7. At 42-8, the Dodgers are tied for third-best, with the 1941 New York Yankees and 1942 St. Louis Cardinals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to the &lt;i&gt;SI&lt;/i&gt; chart, only four post-1954 squads other than this year&#39;s Dodgers have won at least 40 out of 50 games: the 1975 Cincinnati Reds and 1998 New York Yankees (41-9), and the 1977 Kansas City Royals and 2001 Seattle Mariners (40-10). The Oakland A&#39;s 2001 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/OAK/2001-schedule-scores.shtml&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt; at Baseball Reference appears to show them going 40-10 within multiple 50-game stretches in the season (e.g., from having a 55-49 record at one point to later having a 95-59 record), but &lt;i&gt;SI&lt;/i&gt; doesn&#39;t list them. By examining the logs of teams that had won 100 games in a season over roughly the past 15 years, I also discovered two teams that just missed 40-10; in 2002, the A&#39;s and Atlanta Braves each had a 39-11 stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the six 50-game stretches of 39-11 or better from 1998 to the present, there does not seem to be any consistent pattern in terms of when during the season the team got hot. The 1998 Yankees got hot very early in the season; after starting off 1-4, the next thing you knew they were 42-13. The 2001 Mariners also got rolling early on, building upon a 7-2 start to advance their record to 47-12. The 2002 Braves&#39; 39-11 stretch (from 25-24 to 64-35) and the 2013 Dodgers&#39; 42-8 spurt both were during the middle of the season.  Finally, the Oakland A&#39;s two hot stretches (40-10 in 2001 and 39-11 in 2002) were both in the run-up to the end of the season.  </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/6549637839443161231/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=6549637839443161231&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/6549637839443161231'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/6549637839443161231'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/08/dodgers-now-42-8-in-last-50-games.html' title='Dodgers Now 42-8 in Last 50 Games'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-4886801394513222890</id><published>2013-08-09T15:50:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-08-09T15:50:09.824-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Rarity of Braves&#39; and Tigers&#39; Concurrent Winning Streaks</title><content type='html'>Currently, the Atlanta Braves have won &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/schedule/_/name/atl/atlanta-braves&quot;&gt;13 straight games&lt;/a&gt; and the Detroit Tigers, &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/schedule/_/name/det/detroit-tigers&quot;&gt;12 straight&lt;/a&gt;.

Dodgers&#39; hot streak has continued (see posting immediately below the current one). With their &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/recap?id=330805124&quot;&gt;3-2 win last night&lt;/a&gt; at St. Louis, the Dodgers are now 32-7 over their last 39 games. Further, the Dodgers have won their last 15 road games, one of the longest such streaks of all time. The record for consecutive road wins within a single season is 17, shared by the 1984 Tigers and 1916 Giants.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The other team featured in my previous posting, the Tampa Bay Rays, have also remained hot, albeit a little less so than the Dodgers. The Rays are 6-3 since the last posting, making them 25-6 from June 29 onward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, in my previous posting, I wrote with reference to the National League West around the time the Dodgers began making their climb: &quot;I don&#39;t know how many previous instances there have been within a division of all or most of the teams concurrently winning or losing 80% (or more) of their last 10 games, but I suspect it&#39;s pretty rare.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Well, maybe it&#39;s not as rare as I imagined. Just recently, after play on August 4, in the American League Central, here&#39;s how the teams stood after their respective last 10 games: Detroit 9-1, Cleveland 9-1, Kansas City 9-1, Minnesota 5-5, and Chicago White Sox 0-10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From July 26-August 2, Atlanta Braves third-baseman Chris Johnson maintained a streak of getting multiple hits in each of &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/gamelog/_/id/29616/chris-johnson&quot;&gt;eight straight games&lt;/a&gt;. Johnson was far from the record, which is &lt;a href=&quot;http://sabr.org/cmsFiles/Files/records_FEB2010.pdf&quot;&gt;15 straight multi-hit games&lt;/a&gt;, but eight straight is still pretty impressive.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/2018139305659479414/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=2018139305659479414&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2018139305659479414'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2018139305659479414'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/08/major-league-baseball-updates.html' title='Major League Baseball Updates'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-7857240695095212586</id><published>2013-07-26T17:41:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2013-07-26T17:56:22.353-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Dodgers, Rays Use June/July Spurts to Climb Standings</title><content type='html'>Quoting from a &lt;i&gt;Fansided&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://fansided.com/2013/07/03/yasiel-puig-hanley-ramirez-key-surging-los-angeles-dodgers/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;As the sun rose on June 22, the Dodgers were 30-42, a season-worst 12 games under .500. They sat in the basement on the NL West, where they had resided for the bulk of the season, 9.5 games behind the Diamondbacks.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Within about 10 days (after play on July 2),the Dodgers had made up 7 games in the standings, going from 9.5 games back to just 2.5. Entering tonight&#39;s play, L.A. (53-48) is atop the division, leading Arizona by a half-game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As of June 28, the Tampa Bay Rays, stood in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/sport/archives/2013/07/24/2003568021&quot;&gt;fourth place&lt;/a&gt; in the AL East, 7 games behind leading Boston. Entering this evening, the Rays (60-42) are now just a half-game behind the Red Sox in the division.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To dramatize the Dodgers&#39; and Rays&#39; recent hot stretches, I created the following graphic, on which you can click to enlarge it. L.A. has gone 23-6 in its last 29 games (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/schedule/_/name/lad/los-angeles-dodgers&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;), whereas Tampa Bay has gone 19-3 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/schedule/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays&quot;&gt;log&lt;/a&gt;). The teams&#39; opponent in each game and the location (home/away) are shown in each little box.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DvEKbA-cmys/UfK4oHvhGnI/AAAAAAAACcE/Kzm9iKbhCtI/s1600/dodgers+rays.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;90&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DvEKbA-cmys/UfK4oHvhGnI/AAAAAAAACcE/Kzm9iKbhCtI/s400/dodgers+rays.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;On paper, the Dodgers would seem to have one of the best teams in baseball. However, that was not reflected much in the first half of the season, with shortstop &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.truebluela.com/2013/6/9/4411872/hanley-ramirez-injury-dodgers-hamstring-mri&quot;&gt;Hanley Ramirez&lt;/a&gt; and pitcher &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportingnews.com/mlb/story/2013-05-14/zack-greinke-injury-update-dodgers-activate-pitcher-fight-carlos-quentin-fantasy&quot;&gt;Zack Greinke&lt;/a&gt; missing a lot of action due to injuries. The two are now back and Ramirez is hitting at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/gamelog/_/id/6195/hanley-ramirez&quot;&gt;torrid pace&lt;/a&gt; (.384 batting average, 1.123 OPS [on-base average plus slugging]). As noted in the above-cited &lt;i&gt;Fansided&lt;/i&gt; article, another star Dodger pitcher, Clayton Kershaw, has overcome an early-season slump. Finally, newcomer &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/07/baseball-streaks-pirates-puig-cuddyer.html&quot;&gt;Yasiel Puig&lt;/a&gt;, though &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.latimes.com/sports/dodgersnow/la-sp-dn-dodgers-activate-matt-kemp-from-dl-rest-slumping-yasiel-puig-20130721,0,1789496.story&quot;&gt;cooling off a bit&lt;/a&gt;, remains a potent offensive threat. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the Dodgers were making their move in the NL West from June 22-July 2, all of their division-mates were heading in the opposite direction. Listed below are each team&#39;s record, place in the standings, streak, and past-10-games record as of July 2.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bordercolor=&quot;#FFCC00&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #0000cc; width: 100%px;&quot;&gt;	&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;		&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;Streak&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;Last 10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;		&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;Arizona (42-41)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;Lost 5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2-8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;		&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;Colorado (41-43)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;Lost 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;4-6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;		&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;San Diego (40-44)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;Lost 4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2-8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;		&lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;LA Dodgers (39-43)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Won 3&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;9-1&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;		&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;San Francisco (39-44)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;Lost 2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;		&lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2-8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;	&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though all four of the Dodgers&#39; opponents experienced cold spells during the particular 10-day period,  three of them were fairly severe (2-8). These events were not entirely  independent, of course, as six of the Dodgers&#39; wins during the stretch came  against San Diego (2), San Francisco (3), and Colorado (1); mixed in was a four-game series vs.  the Phillies, of which L.A. took 3.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&#39;t know how many previous instances there have been within a division of  all or most of the teams concurrently winning or losing 80% (or more) of  their last 10 games, but I suspect it&#39;s pretty rare.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to this &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://ftw.usatoday.com/2013/07/rays-mlb-tampa-bay-rays-david-price-winning-streak/&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; on the Rays&#39; revival, the team&#39;s improvement seems attributable to many domains (offense, pitching, defense) and players. Of particular note are the successful return of pitcher David Price and the emergence of outfielders Wil Myers and Desmond Jennings.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As some have noted, both the Dodgers and Rays have won a lot of games during their respective hot streaks against teams that are &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/standings&quot;&gt;currently below .500&lt;/a&gt; in the standings. The slate gets tougher for both teams. After their current series against Cincinnati, the Dodgers host the Yankees and (after a swing through Wrigley Field and the Cubs) play in St. Louis. The Rays, meanwhile, are starting a series tonight against the Yankees in the Bronx, then play a make-up game in Boston, and host the Diamondbacks. Fittingly, from August 9 through 11, the Dodgers and Rays will play each other in a three-game series at L.A.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/7857240695095212586/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=7857240695095212586&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7857240695095212586'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7857240695095212586'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/07/dodgers-and-rays-use-junejuly-hot.html' title='Dodgers, Rays Use June/July Spurts to Climb Standings'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-DvEKbA-cmys/UfK4oHvhGnI/AAAAAAAACcE/Kzm9iKbhCtI/s72-c/dodgers+rays.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-2035721205824364046</id><published>2013-07-03T20:24:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-07-03T20:33:33.424-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Looking Back at Chicago-Boston Stanley Cup Finals</title><content type='html'>This year&#39;s NHL Stanley Cup finals between the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=400470605&quot;&gt;victorious Chicago Blackhawks&lt;/a&gt; and the Boston Bruins, which ended a little over a week ago, contained some streak-related developments. To depict these streaks, as well as experiment with information graphics more generally, I created the diagram below. Just start reading in the upper-left corner (corresponding to Game 1, Period 1) and follow the path clockwise, through Games 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Each little box (tinted red for Chicago and yellow for Boston) represents one minute. Goals are depicted by red goal-light symbols and black boxes in the timeline, whereas penalties are denoted by referee-shirt logos and light-blue bars in the timeline. You can enlarge the graphic by clicking on it. Because of the diagram&#39;s size, I had to divide it into three sections (top, middle, and bottom), so you&#39;ll have to click on each section separately to enlarge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T0dOQoGOSxg/UdTsCS3EzqI/AAAAAAAACb0/ebgw0F_yvps/s960/blackhawks-bruins+1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T0dOQoGOSxg/UdTsCS3EzqI/AAAAAAAACb0/ebgw0F_yvps/s400/blackhawks-bruins+1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GhMTOEptWsA/UdTY3DSV9hI/AAAAAAAACbY/dFClwXwOJFc/s960/blackhawks-bruins+2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;285&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GhMTOEptWsA/UdTY3DSV9hI/AAAAAAAACbY/dFClwXwOJFc/s400/blackhawks-bruins+2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qjOFuIKPaGk/UdTY3fRG4_I/AAAAAAAACbc/eR-naFhqbS4/s960/blackhawks-bruins+3.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;300&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qjOFuIKPaGk/UdTY3fRG4_I/AAAAAAAACbc/eR-naFhqbS4/s400/blackhawks-bruins+3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Each team went through a major scoreless streak during the series. The Bruins didn&#39;t score for a span of 100 minutes and 57 seconds (starting roughly 6 minutes into the third period of Game 1 and ending nearly 15 minutes into the second period of Game 2). This stretch is depicted via the dashed black line. The Blackhawks later topped that, experiencing a scoring drought of 129 minutes and 14 seconds; after scoring at the 11:22 mark of the first period of Game 2, Chicago didn&#39;t light the lamp again until nearly 7 minutes into Game 4. This span is shown with a dashed red line.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another offensive difficulty for the Hawks was the power play; for the series as a whole, they scored on only 1 of 19 instances in which the Bruins had a man in the penalty box (a few times, a Chicago player was sent off at the same time as a Boston player, which would not be a power play).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The most memorable aspect of the series would have to be the closing moments. The Blackhawks led the series 3 games to 2, but trailed in the closing minutes of Game 6 by a 2-1 score. Chicago then stunned Boston with two goals just 17 seconds apart (with 1:16 and 0:59 remaining) to win 3-2. Tom Tango cited an estimate that Chicago had only a &lt;a href=&quot;http://tangotiger.com/index.php/site/article/blackhawks-win-expectancy-was-3-percent-and-both-teams-pulled-their-goalie&quot;&gt;3% chance of winning the game&lt;/a&gt; before its late outburst and noted the oddity of both teams being in a position to pull its goalie in the same game (a team down a goal in the closing minutes will almost always bring its goalie to the bench to substitute in a sixth attacking player).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Weird things can happen in hockey (see this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aolnews.com/2011/01/21/nathan-gerbe-scores-2-goals-in-5-seconds-video/&quot;&gt;video of quick goals&lt;/a&gt;), but Chicago&#39;s manner of clinching this year&#39;s Cup is one for the ages.&amp;nbsp; </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/2035721205824364046/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=2035721205824364046&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2035721205824364046'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2035721205824364046'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/07/looking-back-at-blackhawks-bruins.html' title='Looking Back at Chicago-Boston Stanley Cup Finals'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-T0dOQoGOSxg/UdTsCS3EzqI/AAAAAAAACb0/ebgw0F_yvps/s72-c/blackhawks-bruins+1.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-7739502635745694308</id><published>2013-07-01T17:37:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-07-01T17:41:49.310-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Baseball Streaks: Pirates, Puig, Cuddyer, and Scherzer</title><content type='html'>Several streak-related stories are swirling through Major League Baseball at the season&#39;s halfway point (81 games). These stories involve a team, two hitters, and a pitcher. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Which team has the best record? Hint: It&#39;s a team that has recorded &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/sports/pirates/pirates-reach-20-consecutive-losing-seasons-655671/&quot;&gt;sub-.500 records for each of the last 20 years&lt;/a&gt;. Yes, it&#39;s the &lt;b&gt;Pittsburgh Pirates&lt;/b&gt;. Pittsburgh has won nine straight games and has the best record in MLB at this point, 51-30 (.630). The Bucs now need to go only 31-50 (.383) the rest of the way to end their streak of losing seasons. Last year, however, Pittsburgh was in an &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/08/can-pirates-end-streak-of-sub-500.html&quot;&gt;even more advantageous position&lt;/a&gt; to post a winning record -- a 63-47 record as of August 8, which required playing at only a .365 clip the rest of the way -- but still finished with a losing record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of the two hot hitters, one is capturing the imagination of baseball fans as he helps lift his team back into playoff contention, whereas the other has quietly put together a long consecutive-game hitting streak. The first one is &lt;b&gt;Yasiel Puig&lt;/b&gt;, a Los Angeles Dodgers outfielder from Cuba. Puig just completed the first month of his rookie year (June) with &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2013/7/1/4483166/yasiel-puig-dodgers-joe-dimaggio-hit-record&quot;&gt;more hits (44) during a first month&lt;/a&gt; than any player in MLB history, except for Joe DiMaggio (48). However, Puig bested Joltin&#39; Joe in three important offensive categories during the two players&#39; respective first months: batting average (.436 to .381), on-base percentage (.467 to .400), and slugging percentage (.713 to .659). Puig did strike out more times (20 to 8) than DiMaggio during their respective first months. Neither walked much (Puig, 4; DiMaggio, 3). Based on Puig&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/gamelog/_/id/32574/yasiel-puig&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;, I made the following table, which shows that, in the majority of his June contests (14 out of 22), he&#39;s gotten multiple hits in a game.&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BPbjGKRG5b8/UdIXb7pLK5I/AAAAAAAACbE/iOrJ5buUYhI/s632/puig+hits+june+2013.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;135&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BPbjGKRG5b8/UdIXb7pLK5I/AAAAAAAACbE/iOrJ5buUYhI/s400/puig+hits+june+2013.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt; &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The quietly successful hitter is Colorado Rockies outfielder &lt;b&gt;Michael Cuddyer&lt;/b&gt;, who yesterday got a hit in his &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/nationals/cuddyer-runs-hitting-streak-to-27-games/2013/07/01/fdf133dc-e28e-11e2-8657-fdff0c195a79_story.html&quot;&gt;27th straight game&lt;/a&gt;. Cuddyer&#39;s streak &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/gamelog/_/id/4604/michael-cuddyer&quot;&gt;has taken place&lt;/a&gt; from May 28-June 6 and (after missing five games) from June 13-30. His monthly batting averages have been .313 in April, .396 in May, and .347 in June. Even if we assume conservatively that Cuddyer is truly a .300 hitter this year, he still has a .760 probability of getting at least one hit per game if he gets four official at-bats (1 - [.700^4], where .700 is his probability of making an out in each official at-bat, which is then raised to the fourth power).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, Detroit Tigers pitcher &lt;b&gt;Max Scherzer&lt;/b&gt; has gotten a lot of attention for his 12-0 win-loss record to start the season, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/mlb-big-league-stew/max-scherzer-wins-again-becomes-first-pitcher-since-043156432.html&quot;&gt;first hurler to do so&lt;/a&gt; since Roger Clemens in 1986. Many baseball observers (your author included) do not like win-loss record as a metric of pitcher accomplishment, because much of what determines whether a pitcher will win or lose is his teammates&#39; offensive output. As we see in Scherzer&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/gamelog/_/id/28976/max-scherzer&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;, he has gotten wins in games in which he has given up 4 earned runs in 5 innings (April 6), 5 ER in 5 innings (April 24), and 4 ER in 5 innings (May 10). In fact, Scherzer currently ranks 12th among American League pitchers in Earned Run Average (ERA), at 3.10. On another pitching metric, WHIP (walks and hits per inning pitched), Scherzer does better, his .90 placing him second in the AL, only slightly behind Seattle&#39;s Hisashi Iwakuma (.88).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/7739502635745694308/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=7739502635745694308&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7739502635745694308'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7739502635745694308'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/07/baseball-streaks-pirates-puig-cuddyer.html' title='Baseball Streaks: Pirates, Puig, Cuddyer, and Scherzer'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BPbjGKRG5b8/UdIXb7pLK5I/AAAAAAAACbE/iOrJ5buUYhI/s72-c/puig+hits+june+2013.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-2235932239436107752</id><published>2013-06-28T10:56:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-06-28T10:57:48.342-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Stanford Wins Director&#39;s Cup (Overall Athletic Performance) for 19th Straight Year</title><content type='html'>Stanford has won the Learfield Sports Directors&#39; Cup, the long-established marker of overall athletic-department performance, for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/nacda/sports/directorscup/auto_pdf/2013-14/misc_non_event/June27release.pdf&quot;&gt;19th straight year&lt;/a&gt;. Cardinal sports teams accumulated 1261.25 points, just slightly ahead of Florida&#39;s 1244.75. However, Stanford&#39;s score was limited more than Florida&#39;s by the fact that only a school&#39;s 20 best sports (10 men&#39;s and 10 women&#39;s) can count. The Cardinal had four potential point-scoring sports excluded, whereas the Gators only had one.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Stanford fields teams in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gostanford.com/sports/varsity-sports.html&quot;&gt;36 sports&lt;/a&gt;, far more than most schools, so the cap on the number of sports in which a &amp;nbsp;school can receive Directors&#39; Cup points seems fair. Another aspect of the scoring, which seems to benefit Stanford, is that each sport is treated equally in terms of points. Cardinal squads tend to do well in sports such as golf, tennis, and water polo, and less so in &quot;big ticket&quot; sports such as football and men&#39;s basketball. Women&#39;s basketball, which arguably might be the third most-followed college sport in the U.S., is a perennial Cardinal strong suit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(A competing award, the Capital One Cup, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.capitalonecup.com/media/6e13e337-a312-477b-b47d-b25eafd1f781/PDFs/Standings/CoachesPoll_2013_pdf&quot;&gt;weights what appear to be the more popular sports more heavily&lt;/a&gt; than other sports, as well as having separate men&#39;s and women&#39;s prizes; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.capitalonecup.com/media/6e13e337-a312-477b-b47d-b25eafd1f781/PDFs/Standings/CoachesPoll_2013_pdf&quot;&gt;this year&#39;s winners&lt;/a&gt; were UCLA in men&#39;s sports and North Carolina in women&#39;s. Stanford was No.2 in the Capital One women&#39;s standings and outside the Top 10 in the men&#39;s. The Capital One Cup is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.capitalonecup.com/media/298328b3-2f35-4fb2-9522-5c216df18442/PDFs/Standings/2010-2012-capital-one-cup-standings_Final_pdf&quot;&gt;only in its third year&lt;/a&gt;.) &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Back to the Director&#39;s Cup, an NCAA team championship is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nacda.com/directorscup/nacda-directorscup-scoring.html&quot;&gt;worth 100 points&lt;/a&gt;, second-place worth 90, and so forth, regardless of sport. In sports that have a tournament, such as the women&#39;s basketball 64-team competition, all teams in the field receive some points. In other sports, such as track and field, where more than 64 schools appear at the national meet, points are awarded even further down the ladder. For example, Idaho State, which finished 77th in men&#39;s outdoor track, received 5 points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a Michigan alum (Ph.D., 1989), I was hoping that NCAA titles by the men&#39;s swimming and gymnastics teams, the national runner-up finish in men&#39;s basketball, and appearances in the women&#39;s volleyball Final Four and softball Women&#39;s College World Series might give Wolverine athletics a chance to end Stanford&#39;s long streak of Directors&#39; Cup titles. However, Michigan finished fourth. UCLA was third.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/2235932239436107752/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=2235932239436107752&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2235932239436107752'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2235932239436107752'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/06/stanford-wins-directors-cup-overall.html' title='Stanford Wins Director&#39;s Cup (Overall Athletic Performance) for 19th Straight Year'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-3004579873321977045</id><published>2013-06-24T20:21:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2013-06-24T21:12:11.990-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Hawks Join Heat in Winning Title to Cap Off Streaky Season</title><content type='html'>The Chicago Blackhawks&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=400470605&quot;&gt;Stanley Cup-clinching win&lt;/a&gt; tonight creates a hockey parallel with last week&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/21/heat-champions-2013-game-7-spurs-nba-finals_n_3476072.html&quot;&gt;NBA championship&lt;/a&gt; by the Miami Heat.

However, Tuesday&#39;s Game 6 and (if necessary) Thursday&#39;s Game 7 will be played in Miami. Thus, the Spurs have the momentum, whereas the Heat has the home court. How much are these respective, putative advantages worth in an NBA final series?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The sample size of historical NBA finals matching the circumstances of this year&#39;s Heat-Spurs match-up is small. Still, let&#39;s take a look at similar series over the years. It should first be noted that the current 2-3-2 finals format (i.e., two games at the home of the team with the better regular-season record, the next three games at the opponent&#39;s home, and the final two back in the first city) began with the finals of the 1984-85 season. Here are the final series since then in which a team has won Game 5 (abbreviated &quot;G5&quot;) at home to take a 3-2 lead, and then sought to win the title on the road (data from &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_NBA_champions&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;

However, those two experiences -- vs. Phoenix in 1992-93 and vs. Utah in 1997-98 -- are different from those in the table above. In both cases, the Bulls had led 3-1 and failed to close out the series at home in five.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We can expand the database by looking at years prior to the switch to 2-3-2, in which a 2-2-1-1-1 format (usually) was used for the finals. Under this format, a team that won Game 5 at home to go ahead 3-2 had the opportunity to wrap up the series on the road in Game 6 (although the home team for Game 5 knew that it would also play Game 7 at home, if necessary). Staying within the past 50 years, there were eight series in which a team won Game 5 at home to take a 3-2 lead and then went on the road for Game 6 (but not Game 7). They are as follows.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bordercolor=&quot;#FFFFFF&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #99ff66; width: 100%px;&quot;&gt; &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Year&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Won G5 @ Home&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opponent&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Won G6 on Road?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1967-68&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Celtics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lakers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1968-69&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lakers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Celtics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;No&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1969-70&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Knicks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lakers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;No*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1975-76&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Celtics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Suns&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1977-78&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supersonics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bullets (Wizards)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;No&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1979-80&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lakers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;76ers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1980-81&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Celtics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Rockets&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Yes&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1983-84&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Celtics&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lakers&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;No*&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: verdana,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quackit.com/html/html_table_tutorial.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;HTML Tables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;i&gt;*Winner of Game 5 won Game 7 back at home.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Again, it&#39;s a wash. Four teams (shown in &lt;span style=&quot;color: #38761d;&quot;&gt;dark green&lt;/span&gt;) won Game 5 at home to take a 3-2 lead and then captured the title on the road in Game 6. However, another four similarly situated teams (shown in &lt;span style=&quot;color: orange;&quot;&gt;orange&lt;/span&gt;) failed to do so.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we assume that a road team in basketball usually has less than a 50/50 probability of winning, then the fact that a team that won Game 5 at home to take a 3-2 lead won Game 6 on the road 50% of the time in the above years suggests that there may be something to the notion of momentum in this context. There&#39;s a (somewhat) complicating factor, however. With the 2-2-1-1-1 format (prior to 1984-85), the road team in Game 6 would have been the team with the better regular-season record and thus arguably the better team. That may be why Game-5 winners may have done well in Game-6 road contests, as much or more so than benefiting from momentum.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the 2-3-2 era, in contrast, the road team in Game 6 would be the one with the worse regular-season record. Hence, a 50% success rate for such teams in Game 6 speaks well for momentum.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/3343483832432261273/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=3343483832432261273&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3343483832432261273'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3343483832432261273'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/06/trying-to-close-out-nba-final-series-on.html' title='Trying to Close Out an NBA Final Series on the Road After Winning Game 5 at Home to Go Up 3-2'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-2379878673646549418</id><published>2013-06-07T16:55:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2015-01-31T09:58:17.237-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Serena Williams&#39;s Tennis Winning Streak</title><content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0b5394;&quot;&gt;See &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2015/01/serena-williams-beats-maria-sharapova.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;update&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span style=&quot;color: #0b5394;&quot;&gt;after 2015 Australian Open.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Serena Williams brings a career-best&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/espnw/news-commentary/article/9347393/2013-french-open-title-serena-williams-reach&quot;&gt;30-match winning streak&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;into tomorrow&#39;s women&#39;s singles final of the French Open -- and a 12-match winning streak in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matchstat.com/Compare/-241/-503/-7240&quot;&gt;head-to-head matches&lt;/a&gt; against her opponent tomorrow, Maria Sharapova. Williams presumably will be a heavy favorite to win this Grand Slam event, but even if we just look at what she has accomplished in the last few months of non-Grand Slam tournaments, it&#39;s still pretty remarkable.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;First, Williams is a power player, with the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; quoting multiple experts that her serve is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/04/sports/tennis/serena-williamss-serve-makes-the-difference-at-wimbledon.html&quot;&gt;the best ever&lt;/a&gt; in the women&#39;s game. Yet, her 30-match winning streak has occurred &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wtatennis.com/players/player/9044/title/serena-williams&quot;&gt;mostly on clay&lt;/a&gt;, a surface that &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/6906922/the-physics-grass-clay-cement&quot;&gt;slows the ball down&lt;/a&gt;. In fact, of Williams&#39;s 15 Grand Slam titles to date, only one has come at the French Open (2002), which is played on clay. The other 14 have come at the Australian Open, Wimbledon (All-England), and U.S. Open championships, which are played on faster surfaces.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Second, Williams is currently 31 years old, a seemingly advanced age at which to embark on a career-longest winning streak. The study of baseball statistics (&quot;sabermetrics&quot;) has produced &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/how-do-star-hitters-age/&quot;&gt;age curves&lt;/a&gt;&quot; of players&#39; productivity over time. I was not familiar with age curves for tennis, so I created a rough estimate of them for seven all-time great women&#39;s tennis players: Serena and her sister Venus Williams, Margaret Court, Billie Jean King, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova, and Steffi Graf.

The Australian Open has switched back-and-forth &lt;a href=&quot;http://tennis.sporting99.com/australian-open/history.html&quot;&gt;between December and January&lt;/a&gt;, but I used January throughout my analyses. Thus, it&#39;s quite possible that I could be off a year on some of these players&#39; ages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The main finding appears to be that most of the great women&#39;s tennis players of the modern era have tended to tail off beginning in their late twenties. Serena, in contrast, had some (relatively) lean years in her mid-twenties (three Grand Slam titles in the five years from ages 22-26), before experiencing a renaissance from ages 27-30 (six titles in four years).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far as Serena&#39;s current 30-match win streak, she is still quite a ways from the top five women&#39;s winning streaks (Evert holds the fifth-longest streak at 55 straight wins), let alone the longest women&#39;s winning streak of all time, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.realclearsports.com/lists/unbreakable_streakts/martina_navratilova_74_straights_wins.html&quot;&gt;74 matches by Navratilova&lt;/a&gt;.

Standing 6-foot-9 and sporting a deadly three-point shot, Durant fits into what one sportswriter calls the &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbnation.com/2013/3/14/4100262/nba-power-fowards-three-point-shooters-cliff-robinson&quot;&gt;Stretch 4&lt;/a&gt;&quot; category of big guys who can shoot from outside.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Durant is a &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3202/kevin-durant&quot;&gt;career .884 free-throw shooter&lt;/a&gt; as a pro. During the 2012-13 NBA regular season, he was even better at .905. As shown in the following graph depicting each OKC playoff game this year, Durant&#39;s shooting from the stripe continued at this lofty level, for the most part. The team&#39;s free-throw percentages track with Durant&#39;s, in part because Durant gets a &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/team/stats/_/name/okc/oklahoma-city-thunder&quot;&gt;large share of the team&#39;s attempts&lt;/a&gt;, but also because Thunder players generally are good from the line.

In his first eight playoff games (all six against Houston and the first two vs. Memphis), Durant never fell below .800 in any individual contest; cumulatively in these first eight games, he shot .882 (75/85). In Durant&#39;s (and the Thunder&#39;s) final three games, in contrast, he never reached .800 in any contest and shot a cumulative .667 (18/27).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just a blip? Possibly. Fatigue? Maybe. One could do a statistical comparison of Durant in his first eight vs. his last three playoff games. However, most statisticians would probably consider such a test to be &quot;cherry-picking&quot; (deciding to conduct a test &lt;i&gt;only after&lt;/i&gt; seeing a sharp drop in Durant&#39;s free-throw accuracy).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/3773404708198112041/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=3773404708198112041&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3773404708198112041'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3773404708198112041'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/05/a-look-back-at-kevin-durants-playoff.html' title='A Look Back at Kevin Durant&#39;s Playoff FT Shooting'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-F8m2Gb_D0S4/UaEIGQpl7zI/AAAAAAAACZc/oyijJikE56A/s72-c/durant+okc+ft+shooting.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-4603985758261476005</id><published>2013-05-20T15:45:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-20T15:49:41.174-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Lionel Messi&#39;s Recent Soccer Scoring Streak in Spain</title><content type='html'>&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lionel_messi&quot;&gt;Lionel (Leo) Messi&lt;/a&gt;, an Argentinian who plays in Spain for FC Barcelona in the Spanish football/soccer league (&quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Liga&quot;&gt;La Liga&lt;/a&gt;&quot;), had his 21-game goal-scoring streak ended on May 12. According to &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sportskeeda.com/2013/05/13/lionel-messis-record-goal-scoring-streak-ends/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;His streak of scoring in his last 21 consecutive league games started on  11th November last year, in an away league match against Mallorca,  where he scored 2 goals. With no goal from Leo today, the longest-ever  streak of scoring in a league ended.&quot; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The same article lists how many goals Messi scored in each of the 21 games during the streak. For the first six games of the streak, he scored two goals (known as a &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://wiki.answers.com/Q/In_soccer_what_is_a_brace&quot;&gt;brace&lt;/a&gt;&quot;) in each outing.&amp;nbsp; He scored one goal in each of the next four games, then &lt;a href=&quot;http://bigstory.ap.org/article/liverpool-spurs-exit-fa-cup-vs-lower-tier-teams&quot;&gt;erupted for four goals&lt;/a&gt; in a January 27 game against Osasuna. In the final 10 games of the streak, Messi scored a single goal seven times and a brace three times. All told, he scored 33 goals during the streak, 1.57 per game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Probably like most U.S. sports fans, I get most of my exposure to international soccer through the quadrennial World Cup. I recall that the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_World_Cup&quot;&gt;2010 World Cup&lt;/a&gt; had many 1-0 scores, which made me wonder if goals were similarly rare in La Liga. If so, Messi would not only be a great soccer player, but also a miracle worker.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at FC Barcelona&#39;s 2012-13 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.fcbarcelona.com/football/first-team/calendar&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt; (with La Liga contests denoted by a color-wheel logo and the word &quot;league&quot;), the team has averaged 3.03 goals in league games, as of this writing (109 goals in 36 games). Thus, whether it&#39;s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1527423-is-la-liga-really-a-weak-defensive-league&quot;&gt;relative abilities of offensive and defensive players&lt;/a&gt; or the style of play, La Liga appears much more conducive to scoring than World Cup competition.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&#39;t get me wrong. Even in an apparently offense-friendly league, what Messi has done is unprecedented -- by a wide margin, as the previous La Liga consecutive scoring record was &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1587193-lionel-messi-has-now-scored-for-barca-against-all-other-la-liga-teams-in-a-row&quot;&gt;10 games&lt;/a&gt;. Also, as noted in the linked article in the previous paragraph, Messi also has set a scoring record when competing for Argentina in international play, so his scoring ability clearly transcends any particular league.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/4603985758261476005/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=4603985758261476005&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4603985758261476005'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4603985758261476005'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/05/lionel-messis-soccer-goal-scoring.html' title='Lionel Messi&#39;s Recent Soccer Scoring Streak in Spain'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-5672502458927109543</id><published>2013-05-03T20:24:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-03T20:42:36.906-07:00</updated><title type='text'>12 (Or Is It 14?) Straight Tie-Breakers Lost by Haase</title><content type='html'>This development is a little old, but I only noticed it today. Jeff Sackmann wrote on April 12 at his &quot;Heavy Topspin&quot; tennis website that men&#39;s pro Robin Haase &lt;a href=&quot;http://heavytopspin.com/2013/04/12/robin-haases-unlucky-13-tiebreaks/&quot;&gt;had lost 13 consecutive tie-breakers&lt;/a&gt;. According to Sackmann:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;No other active player has a streak of more than seven, and no  tour-level regular has lost more than his last six. &amp;nbsp;In fact, Haase is  now one lost tiebreak away from tying the all-time ATP [Association of Tennis Professionals] record of 14,  jointly held by Graham Stilwell and Colin Dibley, two players who accomplished their feats in the 1970s.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With a 1-6, 6-2, 6-7 &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.rsport.ru/stat/tennis/match/20130422/658024395/stat.html&quot;&gt;loss to Pablo Carreno-Busta&lt;/a&gt; on April 22, Haase has, in fact, now technically tied the record of 14 straight lost tie-breakers. Why do I say &quot;technically&quot;? If one peruses the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Robin-Haase.aspx?t=pa&quot;&gt;ATP World Tour website&lt;/a&gt; for Haase&#39;s results, starting with the most recent ones and working backwards in time, one counts &quot;only&quot; 12 lost tie-breaks before noticing a breaker that he won. This win by Haase occurred on May 13, 2012 at the ATP World Tour Masters in Rome, as he beat  Sergiy Stakhovsky, 6-4, 7-6 (11-9). Prior to winning that tie-breaker, Haase had lost his two previous ones.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason Haase&#39;s streak is officially listed as being 14, Sackmann has confirmed, is that the tie-breaker Haase won over Stakhovsky occurred in a &lt;i&gt;qualifying-round&lt;/i&gt; match (note the &quot;Q1&quot; on the ATP site), not the tournament draw proper. If the ATP&#39;s policy has always been that only main-draw matches count for record purposes, so be it. Perhaps the thinking is that, because the level of competition presumably is less demanding in the qualifying rounds than in the main draw, only the latter should be counted for record purposes. Let&#39;s be clear, though: &lt;i&gt;Whether one considers Haase&#39;s tie-breaker losing streak to be 12 or 14, it&#39;s unusually long in either case! &amp;nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The reason I was looking up all of Haase&#39;s matches, in the first place, is that I was curious with regards to how many points he was garnering in the tie-breakers during his stretch of futility. Has he been getting blown out in them (e.g., 7-0, 7-1, 7-2)? That might suggest a major freeze-up. Or, on the other hand, has he been taking his opponents to the wire, losing the tie-breakers by the minimum two points (e.g., 7-5, 8-6, 9-7)? If the latter, Haase wouldn&#39;t be experiencing full implosion at the umpire&#39;s call of &quot;Games are tied at 6-all,&quot; but one would still have to wonder why he consistently lost close tie-breakers. I created the following graph to show Haase&#39;s frequency of different point totals in tie-breakers during his losing streak. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jkDG1QUZxls/UYR5bVfllII/AAAAAAAACXk/XYcJTKywy7o/s1600/tie-breaker+losing+streak.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;303&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-jkDG1QUZxls/UYR5bVfllII/AAAAAAAACXk/XYcJTKywy7o/s400/tie-breaker+losing+streak.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The picture is mixed, yielding what statisticians call a bimodal distribution (i.e., two values tied for being most frequent). Five times, Haase was blown out 7-2, whereas he lost another tie-break 7-3. However, he has also stayed within two points on five occasions, losing 7-5 (twice) or 8-6 (thrice).&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sackmann has done extensive research on the likelihood of winning tie-breakers, which you can find by following the links in his various Heavy Topspin postings (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://heavytopspin.com/2012/10/17/more-tiebreaks-than-expected/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). Sackmann has developed formulas for how many tie-breaks a given player would be &lt;i&gt;expected&lt;/i&gt; to win, given the player&#39;s success for entire matches at winning points on serve and receiving. Players with better-than-average skills should win more than 50% of tie-breakers, whereas those with less-stellar skills should win fewer. Sackmann finds that, &quot;Aside from a small minority of players with extensive tiebreak experience (such as Roger Federer, John Isner, and Andy Roddick), ATP pros tend to win about as many breakers as &#39;expected.&#39;&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Obviously, Haase has been an outlier on the unfavorable end. Interested readers can readily follow Haase&#39;s match-by-match results, to find out if/when his streak of lost tie-breakers ends. As noted above, the ATP website has &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.atpworldtour.com/Tennis/Players/Top-Players/Robin-Haase.aspx?t=pa&quot;&gt;Haase&#39;s results&lt;/a&gt; available.

To some extent, one could say that there always seems to be a team or two starting off with a bang every year. Last year, for example, the Rangers &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/schedule/_/name/tex/year/2012/seasontype/2/half/1/texas-rangers&quot;&gt;started off 15-4&lt;/a&gt;, whereas the Dodgers began with a &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/schedule/_/name/lad/year/2012/half/1/los-angeles-dodgers&quot;&gt;12-3 burst&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, if the Braves, A&#39;s, Red Sox, or Rockies can continue to mow down opponents, they may be able to join the pantheon of teams with all-time great starts. This 2011 Yahoo! Sports &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/news?slug=ycn-8282683&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; lists &quot;Five of the best starts in baseball history.&quot; Three of them might be considered fabulous long-term starts: 30-5 by the 1902 Pirates, 33-7 by the 1939 Yankees, and 35-5 by the 1984 Tigers.* The other two great starts were over a shorter term: 13-0 by the 1982 Braves and 17-1 by the 1987 Brewers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Blogger &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.jimmancari.com/2013/04/19/at-home-plate-braves-instilling-fear-in-favored-nationals/&quot;&gt;Jim Mancari&lt;/a&gt; identifies the pillars of the Braves&#39; strong start this year:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Justin Upton has already clubbed a league-leading eight home runs,  and Evan Gattis — who is supposed to just be a placeholder for the  injured Brian McCann — has shown impressive pop at the plate.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;[Chipper] Jones’ replacement Chris Johnson is hitting over .400 to start the  season — Chipper who? Freddie Freeman is also over the .400 mark to  start the year.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;It’s a small sample size, but the Braves have the capability to give  the [Washington] Nationals fits all season...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;The starting pitching staff has been great so far. Through his first  three starts, Paul Maholm has not given up a run — earned or unearned —  in 20 1/3 innings. Tim Hudson, Kris Medlen and Mike Minor have also  looked good early.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Where the Braves definitely have the Nationals beat is in the  bullpen. Closer Craig Kimbrel is perfect in save opportunities and has  only allowed two hits and two walks (no runs) in 6 2/3 innings of work.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For Oakland, a fast start seems almost out of character, as recent A&#39;s squads have tended to be at their best in the second half of the season. The A&#39;s had a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/08/mlb-teams-in-july-hot-cold-and_1.html&quot;&gt;hot July&lt;/a&gt; last year and also did very well in August during &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2006/08/i-wanted-to-tie-bow-to-wrap-up-three.html&quot;&gt;several seasons&lt;/a&gt; in the 2000s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We also, of course, have seen some terrible starts to the 2013 season. Not surprising is that of the Miami Marlins (3-13), who undertook an off-season &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/marlins/2012/11/14/many-burned-by-marlins-fire-sale/1705855/&quot;&gt;fire sale&lt;/a&gt;.

Hot shooting from behind the three-point arc -- including four straight shots without a miss by reserve guard Spike Albrecht -- had given the Wolverines their sizable lead at this point. However, in a two-minute stretch that will give Michigan fans nightmares for years to come, Louisville&#39;s Luke Hancock hit four straight treys of his own and, next thing you knew, the teams were heading to the locker room with the Wolverines ahead only 38-37 at intermission. So compelling was the first-half three-point duel, it inspired the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; to write a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/sports/ncaabasketball/a-3-point-shootout-between-michigans-spike-albrecht-and-louisvilles-luke-hancock.html?pagewanted=all&amp;amp;_r=0&quot;&gt;human interest story&lt;/a&gt; on Hancock and Albrecht.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/playbyplay?gameId=330980097&quot;&gt;play-by-play sheet&lt;/a&gt; of the Louisville-Michigan game, I have graphed all three-point attempts of the first half. The chart indicates which player (by last initial) took each shot (UM players depicted in blue and UL players in red), with how much time remaining in the half, and whether the shot was good (bright colors in top row) or a miss (lighter colors in bottom row). You may click on the graphic to enlarge it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-egrzsXQ6MJI/UWYXr0LbgVI/AAAAAAAACUM/ULZ7CUtJLbk/s1600/hot+hand++graphics+(AR+PPT).jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;178&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-egrzsXQ6MJI/UWYXr0LbgVI/AAAAAAAACUM/ULZ7CUtJLbk/s400/hot+hand++graphics+(AR+PPT).jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Albrecht and Hancock each hit four first-half threes, as can be seen, Hancock&#39;s occurred in much quicker succession. Also, until Hancock&#39;s shooting outburst, Michigan had made six treys to only one for Louisville.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Louisville dominated the second half except for some brief stretches, with Hancock hitting a fifth three-pointer to put the Cardinals up 76-66 with 3:27 left in the game. The final score was 82-76 for UL.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hancock went 5-for-5 from downtown in the title game, as well as 3-for-5 on treys vs. Wichita State in the national semifinal, giving him an impressive 8-for-10 three-point shooting percentage in the Final Four (see Hancock&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/player/gamelog/_/id/46425/luke-hancock&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;). Such a shooting performance by Hancock in the biggest games of the season would have seemed very unlikely, however, based on his start to the 2012-13 campaign. A transfer from George Mason University whose Louisville career began last fall, Hancock compiled an ugly 9-of-41 (.220) record on three-point attempts in his first eight games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though he later had some good three-point shooting games (e.g., &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=330610183&quot;&gt;4-of-5 at Syracuse&lt;/a&gt; on March 2), Hancock entered the Final Four (including the regular season, Big East tournament, and first four games of the NCAA tournament) hitting only 55-for-148 (.372) from downtown.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One can calculate the probability of a prior .372 shooter hitting 8 (or more) of his next 10 three-point attempts, using what is known as a &lt;a href=&quot;http://vassarstats.net/binomialX.html&quot;&gt;binomial probability calculator&lt;/a&gt;. This probability turns out to be .007, a little less than 1-in-100. Unlikely, but not astronomical.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What about Michigan&#39;s Albrecht? As his &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/player/gamelog/_/id/61807/spike-albrecht&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt; shows, Albrecht attempted far fewer three-pointers during the season than did Hancock. In fact, until Monday night&#39;s championship game, the frosh Albrecht had never attempted more than 2 three-point shots in a single game. For the regular season and Big 10 tournament combined, Albrecht made 9-of-23 (.391) behind the arc.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the Wolverines&#39; NCAA tournament opener vs. South Dakota State, Albrecht didn&#39;t attempt any treys. In each of the next three tournament games -- vs. Virginia Commonwealth, Kansas, and Florida -- Albrecht went 1-for-1 on three-pointers. In the national semifinal vs. Syracuse, Albrecht upped his three-point output to 2-for-2. He then, of course, hit his first 4 shots from beyond the arc in the title game against Louisville, making him 9-of-9 for the entire NCAA tournament at that point. With 11:28 left in the game, Albrecht missed a three-point shot that would have put UM, then trailing 52-54, back in the lead. The miss was the only mar on Albrecht&#39;s tournament three-point record, which ended up 9-for-10.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Returning to the binomial probability calculator, we ask in Albrecht&#39;s case what the probability is of a prior .391 shooter making 9 (or more) of his next 10 three-point shots. That probability is .001 or 1-in-1,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Clearly, two rare performances were on display Monday night!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/2273739528275412734/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=2273739528275412734&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2273739528275412734'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2273739528275412734'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/04/louisvilles-hancock-and-michigans.html' title='Louisville&#39;s Hancock and Michigan&#39;s Albrecht Exhibit Hot Hands in First Half of Men&#39;s College Hoops Title Game'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-egrzsXQ6MJI/UWYXr0LbgVI/AAAAAAAACUM/ULZ7CUtJLbk/s72-c/hot+hand++graphics+(AR+PPT).jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-7106280585562405084</id><published>2013-03-31T15:54:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2013-04-04T14:53:56.177-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Aftermath of Heat Streak</title><content type='html'>Bill Simmons offers a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.grantland.com/story/_/id/9111798/the-heat-hindsight&quot;&gt;lengthy postmortem&lt;/a&gt; on the Miami Heat&#39;s 27-game winning streak, which ended last Wednesday in Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE (4/4/2013):&lt;/b&gt; Arturo Galletti offers a &lt;a href=&quot;http://wagesofwins.com/2013/04/01/comparing-the-streaks-across-time/&quot;&gt;statistical comparison&lt;/a&gt; of the three longest NBA winning streaks in history (1971-72 Lakers&#39; 33 games, 2012-13 Heat&#39;s 27, and 2007-08 Rockets&#39; 22).

Three of the 14 games were tied after regulation play, with the Pens winning two of them during the five-minute sudden-death overtime period and one in the post-overtime shoot-out (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/schedule/_/name/pit/pittsburgh-penguins&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The longest winning streak in league history is also held by the Penguins franchise, as the 1992-93 squad won 17 straight. Looking at the Penguins&#39; 1992-93 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hockey-reference.com/teams/PIT/1993_games.html&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;, we see that the winning streak occurred from March 9-April 10, 1993, and that two of the wins occurred in overtime.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Five-minute overtime was introduced in 1983-84, which meant games could still end as ties. Shoot-outs to determine a winner, if the overtime period had not, began in 2005-06 (click &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Overtime_%28ice_hockey%29&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for a history of hockey overtime rule changes).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the pre-overtime era, in which games could end as ties after 60 minutes, the NHL record winning streak was 15 games by the 1981-82 New York Islanders (January 21-February 20, 1982). Arguably, the Islanders&#39; streak is more impressive than the &#39;92-&#39;93 Penguins&#39; streak, due to the overtime rule changes. Had the rules in &#39;92-&#39;93 been such that deadlocked games after regulation been entered into the books as ties, the Penguins would have won only 12 straight.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #0b5394;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; The Penguins extended their winning streak to 15 games, but then &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=400443008&quot;&gt;lost 4-1 to Buffalo&lt;/a&gt; on April 2.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/1231967213611274918/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=1231967213611274918&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/1231967213611274918'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/1231967213611274918'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/nhl-penguins-win-14th-straight.html' title='NHL: Penguins Win 14th Straight'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-6068630137004421492</id><published>2013-03-28T07:43:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-29T12:38:23.529-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Miami Heat Winning Streak Ended at 27 Games</title><content type='html'>With the Chicago Bulls&#39; 101-97 &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278782&quot;&gt;victory over Miami&lt;/a&gt; last night, the Heat&#39;s winning streak has fallen six short of the NBA record 33-game mark set by the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;My primary impression from the Heat-Bulls game is that Miami never got the late barrage of three-point shots that had carried it to victories in other games during the streak. The Heat shot only &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=400278782&quot;&gt;7-of-20 for the game&lt;/a&gt; from behind the arc. Four of these made shots occurred in the second half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Miami did experience a little boomlet of three-point success late in the third quarter, when it was either tying or taking a one-point lead in the game. According to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=400278782&amp;amp;period=0&quot;&gt;play-by-play sheet&lt;/a&gt;, Mario Chalmers hit a three with 5:31 remaining in the third, followed by a pair of Shane Battier treys at the 4:30 and 2:25 marks of the third. What followed were seven straight Miami misses from downtown, until Chris Bosh made a three with just five seconds left in the game.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Contrast the Heat&#39;s poor three-point shooting at Chicago with how Miami had done while winning some of its most recent games during the streak:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Against Orlando (win number 27), the Heat went &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=400278769&quot;&gt;7-of-10 from long distance&lt;/a&gt; in the final 15 minutes of the game.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Against Cleveland (win 24), Miami hit 6-of-7 treys during a fourth-quarter stretch in scoring an &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/bizarre-game-sends-heat-win-streak-to-24.html&quot;&gt;amazing comeback win&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Four three-pointers in roughly a two-minute span helped Miami &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/heat-uses-28-4-spurt-vs-toronto-to.html&quot;&gt;put away Toronto&lt;/a&gt; (win 22).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/6068630137004421492/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=6068630137004421492&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/6068630137004421492'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/6068630137004421492'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/miami-heat-winning-streak-ended-at-27.html' title='Miami Heat Winning Streak Ended at 27 Games'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-4740621534597013908</id><published>2013-03-27T09:33:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-27T09:37:16.809-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Comparing This Year&#39;s Miami Heat (27 Straight Wins) to the 1971-72 L.A. Lakers (33 Straight Wins)</title><content type='html'>Having &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278769&quot;&gt;increased its winning streak to 27 games&lt;/a&gt; Monday night, the Miami Heat is now within reasonable striking distance of the NBA record 33-game winning streak of the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Heat has had to come back from some pretty big second-half deficits, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/bizarre-game-sends-heat-win-streak-to-24.html&quot;&gt;27 points to Cleveland &lt;/a&gt;midway through the third quarter and &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/miami-again-turns-up-heat-in-fourth.html&quot;&gt;13 points to Boston&lt;/a&gt; with 8:26 left in the fourth. Nothing has come easy for Miami. Even the lowly Charlotte Bobcats, owners of the NBA&#39;s worst record (currently 16-54, .229) &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=400278761&amp;amp;period=0&quot;&gt;jumped out to a 19-8 lead&lt;/a&gt; over the Heat last Sunday, before Miami came back and took control.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a previous posting, I noted that, in contrast to this year&#39;s Heat, the 1971-72 Lakers &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2007/01/today-is-35th-anniversary-of-ending-of.html&quot;&gt;rarely seemed to have trouble&lt;/a&gt; during their 33-game streak. However, that conclusion was based only on final margins of victory, without taking into account the possibility that the Lakers struggled early in games and only pulled away toward the end.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have now gone back and looked at the Lakers&#39; 1971-72 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/LAL/1972_games.html&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;, to get more detail on each of the team&#39;s games during the streak. Specifically, I checked the quarter-by-quarter line score, which is part of the box score for each game. To take an example, in the Lakers&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197112030PHI.html&quot;&gt;December 3, 1971 game at Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, which was L.A.&#39;s 16th win during the streak, the line score of points per quarter read as follows (I added the cumulative score at the end of each period in parentheses).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bordercolor=&quot;#990099&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;background-color: yellow; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: left;&quot;&gt; &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;1st&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;3rd&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;4th&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Final Score&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #4c1130;&quot;&gt;Lakers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #4c1130;&quot;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #4c1130;&quot;&gt;39 (58)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #4c1130;&quot;&gt;36 (94)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #4c1130;&quot;&gt;37 (131)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #4c1130;&quot;&gt;131&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;76ers&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;39 (69)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;24 (93)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;23 (116)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;116&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: verdana,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10px; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quackit.com/html/html_table_tutorial.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;HTML Tables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I then plotted the Lakers&#39; leads or deficits at the end of each quarter, for each game during the streak. Also, to get an idea of how L.A. did against opponents of varying quality, I made separate plots for games against top-tier (.537 winning percentage and above), middle-tier (.439-.512), and bottom-tier (the expansion Buffalo, Cleveland, and Portland clubs, all of which finished last in their respective divisions) opponents, based on teams&#39; records in the preceding, &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1970%E2%80%9371_NBA_season&quot;&gt;1970-71 season&lt;/a&gt;. (The Lakers did not play against the Cincinnati Royals, who were .402 in 1970-71, during the streak.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As the first graph shows, in games during the streak against top opponents, the Lakers tended to hold modest leads after the first quarter, which they gradually expanded over the course of the game. The bottom curve represents the above-described Philly game, in which L.A. trailed by 11 points after the first and second quarters, led by 1 after three quarters, and won by 15. The one game touching the break-even point (red line) after four quarters was a December 10, 1971 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/197112100LAL.html&quot;&gt;overtime win over Phoenix&lt;/a&gt;, the Lakers&#39; 20th win during the streak. In that game, the Lakers failed to hold a 12-point lead over the Suns after three quarters. The box score shows Wilt Chamberlain going 0-for-6 from the free-throw line overall; if some of those attempts took place in the fourth quarter, that could explain Phoenix&#39;s comeback. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lsFJ7EOIbkg/UVMQRhlKJZI/AAAAAAAACTc/TDV9vfNOkn8/s1600/lakers+1.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;387&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lsFJ7EOIbkg/UVMQRhlKJZI/AAAAAAAACTc/TDV9vfNOkn8/s400/lakers+1.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Against mid-tier opponents, the Lakers did have some first-half difficulties, but usually led after three quarters.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u7XUPW0PywE/UVMQYweSUqI/AAAAAAAACTk/YW5Kivhkysk/s1600/lakers+2.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;386&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-u7XUPW0PywE/UVMQYweSUqI/AAAAAAAACTk/YW5Kivhkysk/s400/lakers+2.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Finally, against bottom-tier/recent-expansion opponents, the Lakers generally did not win by blow-out. The Buffalo Braves (now the L.A. Clippers), in particular, gave the Lakers trouble in the first and second quarters. The 1971-72 Lakers thus were similar to this year&#39;s Miami Heat in sometimes facing early deficits against weak competition.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AvMN9Kbq-0Q/UVMQo-tVetI/AAAAAAAACTs/EhdWzIMf2-I/s1600/lakers+3.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;395&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-AvMN9Kbq-0Q/UVMQo-tVetI/AAAAAAAACTs/EhdWzIMf2-I/s400/lakers+3.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Why is margin of victory important? In addition to the coronary health of Heat fans, margin of victory affects the team&#39;s ability to give LeBron James and other top players some rest time.

The Heat then went on a 28-7 run to cut the deficit to 74-68, before a Cleveland three-pointer to end the period made it 77-68 (see &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=400278729&amp;amp;period=0&quot;&gt;play-by-play&lt;/a&gt; sheet).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Heat opened the final stanza on a 9-0 run to tie the game at 77-all and then scored another 18 points (to the Cavs&#39; 9), so that Miami had a 95-86 lead with 3:01 left in the game. Miami&#39;s 27-9 run was powered by a stretch of 6-of-7 shooting from three-point range (three consecutive treys from LeBron James before he missed one, followed by two from Ray Allen, and one from Mario Chalmers). &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One might have expected the Heat to win going away at that point, but the Cavs fought to within 96-95 with 44 seconds remaining and had some chances to win or tie the game in the closing seconds.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next up for Miami: The Detroit Pistons come to south Florida on Friday night.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/8199592204341481331/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=8199592204341481331&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8199592204341481331'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8199592204341481331'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/bizarre-game-sends-heat-win-streak-to-24.html' title='Bizarre Game Sends Heat Win Streak to 24'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-934227920765115959</id><published>2013-03-19T07:13:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-19T07:16:49.164-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Miami Again Turns Up Heat in Fourth Quarter, Beats Boston for 23rd Straight Win</title><content type='html'>A big fourth-quarter run has become the Miami Heat&#39;s &lt;i&gt;modus operandi&lt;/i&gt; of late, as the team&#39;s winning streak has now reached 23 games, the second longest in NBA history. After using a &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/heat-uses-28-4-spurt-vs-toronto-to.html&quot;&gt;28-4 spurt Sunday&lt;/a&gt; to finish off Toronto, the Heat needed a big comeback at Boston Monday night -- and got it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trailing 96-83 to the Celtics with 8:26 left in the game, LeBron James hit a three, kicking off a 9-0 Miami spurt to cut the deficit to 96-92. After a Boston trey, the Heat went on a 9-1 run to take a 101-100 lead with 2:40 left. Things were tight the rest of the way, with a long two-point jumper by James putting the Heat ahead 105-103 with 10 seconds left. The lead stood, as a final Celtic three-point attempt bounced off the rim. Click &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=400278718&amp;amp;period=4&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for the fourth quarter play-by-play sheet.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;According to a chart accompanying ESPN.com&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278718&quot;&gt;game article&lt;/a&gt;, Miami&#39;s 17-point deficit in the first half last night was the team&#39;s largest during the streak. The Heat also has faced deficits of 16, 14, and 11 during the streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*** &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/heat-wave-has-miami-winning-streak-at.html&quot;&gt;Not many games&lt;/a&gt; during the streak have gone to the wire, but when they have, James has come through with game-winning shots. Not only last night, but also in a &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=400278623&quot;&gt;97-96 win over Orlando&lt;/a&gt; on March 6, did he score the go-ahead points. Where does James rank among the league&#39;s best &quot;clutch&quot; players?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The website &lt;i&gt;82 Games&lt;/i&gt; keeps various kinds of statistics on clutch performance. For the most recent full season of available data (2011-12), on one measure of performance under pressure, namely &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.82games.com/1112/CSORT11.HTM&quot;&gt;point-production per 48 minutes of &quot;clutch time,&quot;&lt;/a&gt; James ranked 17th in the league. On another measure, shooting percentage on &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.82games.com/gamewinningshots.htm&quot;&gt;potential game-winning shots&lt;/a&gt; (based on statistics through 2009), James&#39;s .340 ranked behind several players, including Carmelo Anthony (.481) and Ray Allen (.385).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Historically, James has shown the ability to &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2007/06/sports-world-is-abuzz-over-last-nights.html&quot;&gt;take over a game completely&lt;/a&gt; down the stretch. The &lt;i&gt;82 Games&lt;/i&gt; statistics may take account of this somewhat, but not totally.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;***&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Heat is not the only NBA team with a long winning streak. The Denver Nuggets won their &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278719&quot;&gt;12th straight&lt;/a&gt; last night. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/934227920765115959/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=934227920765115959&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/934227920765115959'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/934227920765115959'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/miami-again-turns-up-heat-in-fourth.html' title='Miami Again Turns Up Heat in Fourth Quarter, Beats Boston for 23rd Straight Win'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-2893380232849353012</id><published>2013-03-18T15:43:00.004-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-18T15:43:38.428-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Heat Uses 28-4 Spurt vs. Toronto to Advance Winning Streak to 22</title><content type='html'>With yesterday&#39;s 108-91 victory over the Toronto Raptors, the Miami Heat &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278705&quot;&gt;extended its winning streak&lt;/a&gt; to 22 games, tying for the second-longest such streak in NBA history. The key to Miami&#39;s win over Toronto was explosiveness based on three-point shooting. It&#39;s a familiar theme for the Heat, which used &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/06/i-would-say-dominant-story-of-this.html&quot;&gt;success from behind the arc&lt;/a&gt; to win the NBA finals last year. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Going back to yesterday&#39;s win, the Heat ran off a 28-4 spurt in roughly a six and one-half minute segment of the fourth quarter to put away the Raptors. Based on the fourth-quarter &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/playbyplay?gameId=400278705&amp;amp;period=4&quot;&gt;play-by-play sheet&lt;/a&gt;, I have charted all field-goal and free-throw attempts by both teams during this stretch in the following graphic (which you may click to enlarge). The graphic attempts to depict &lt;i&gt;time&lt;/i&gt; (minutes left shown in grey), &lt;i&gt;team&lt;/i&gt; (Miami orange, Toronto purple), &lt;i&gt;shot distance&lt;/i&gt; (length of bars, see legend below), and &lt;i&gt;shot success&lt;/i&gt; (upper-half represents &quot;good,&quot; and lower-half, missed shots), all at a glance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-V8WA5-WJHzw/UUcua5kJpOI/AAAAAAAACTM/w1Lh1_Jp5Pc/s1600/heat+vs+raptors.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;228&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-V8WA5-WJHzw/UUcua5kJpOI/AAAAAAAACTM/w1Lh1_Jp5Pc/s400/heat+vs+raptors.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above the white horizontal line, the solid shapes for made shots are far more prevalent for Miami (orange) than for Toronto (purple). Ray Allen&#39;s burst of made three-pointers at the 6:37, 6:07, and 5:09 marks is highlighted, as are Toronto&#39;s mere four points. Below the white line, in contrast, the outlined shapes for missed shots are far more prevalent for Toronto than Miami. For whatever reason, the Raptors were not getting (or choosing to take) shots near the bucket, as all their field-goal attempts during the stretch were long two-pointers and three-pointers.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Heat has a quick turnaround, facing the Celtics in Boston tonight. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/2893380232849353012/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=2893380232849353012&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2893380232849353012'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2893380232849353012'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/heat-uses-28-4-spurt-vs-toronto-to.html' title='Heat Uses 28-4 Spurt vs. Toronto to Advance Winning Streak to 22'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-V8WA5-WJHzw/UUcua5kJpOI/AAAAAAAACTM/w1Lh1_Jp5Pc/s72-c/heat+vs+raptors.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-2009230518738641398</id><published>2013-03-15T15:05:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-17T12:10:35.779-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Texas Tech Pitcher Trey Masek: 32 Straight Innings Without Allowing a Run</title><content type='html'>Texas Tech pitcher Trey Masek has pitched 32 innings so far this college-baseball season without giving up a run: six innings against &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-basebl/stats/2012-2013/ttu03.html#GAME.PLY&quot;&gt;BYU&lt;/a&gt;, nine each vs. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-basebl/stats/2012-2013/ttu07.html#GAME.PLY&quot;&gt;UConn&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-basebl/stats/2012-2013/ttu11.html#GAME.PLY&quot;&gt;LaSalle&lt;/a&gt;, and eight against the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-basebl/stats/2012-2013/ttu16.html#GAME.PLY&quot;&gt;University of Texas-Arlington&lt;/a&gt; (clicking on the opponent&#39;s name will take you to the play-by-play sheet for that game). The following graphic (which you may click to enlarge), shows threats Masek has faced (e.g., runners on second and third with two out) by game and inning.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KIiH2RyQ3Ro/UUOSVJZtg5I/AAAAAAAACS8/Gq5qoOq-1Dk/s1600/masek+streak.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;270&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KIiH2RyQ3Ro/UUOSVJZtg5I/AAAAAAAACS8/Gq5qoOq-1Dk/s400/masek+streak.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve incorporated into the chart an important element, namely the likelihood of a batting team scoring at least one run for a given outs/runners situation. These probabilities come from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.boydsworld.com/data/ert.html&quot;&gt;Boyd&#39;s World&lt;/a&gt; college-baseball statistics website, based on huge amounts of Division I data from 2011-2012. For example, in Masek&#39;s very first inning of the season, vs. BYU, he allowed the Cougars to have runners on first and second with no outs. The average team, based on the Boyd&#39;s World statistics, would have a 71% probability of scoring at least one run in that scenario. Yet Masek got out of the jam.  Masek has faced six situations thus far in which the opponents had a 47% or better chance of scoring (which includes two instances of opponents having scoring probabilities in the 70s).     &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The closest Masek has come to giving up a run was when a UConn batter hit a single with a runner on second in the seventh inning; the runner was thrown out at the plate.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though Masek has seen his share of dicey situations this season, he finally seemed to get on a roll in the UT-Arlington game, “&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-basebl/recaps/030913aak.html&quot;&gt;retiring the final 19 batters he faced&lt;/a&gt;.”  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The NCAA Division I record for&lt;a href=&quot;http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/baseball_RB/2012/D1.pdf&quot;&gt; consecutive scoreless innings pitched within the same season&lt;/a&gt; is 47, by &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Todd_Helton&quot;&gt;Todd Helton&lt;/a&gt; of the University of Tennessee in 1994. Helton, of course, went on to a long and productive major-league career as a first-basemen for the Colorado Rockies. There was one longer streak that carried over from one season to the next, with George Plender of Vermont putting 60 straight zeroes on the scoreboard in a span that encompassed the 1954 and &#39;55 seasons.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Masek&#39;s next scheduled outing is &lt;a href=&quot;http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/text/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/2012-13/misc_non_event/BBGameNotes031513.pdf&quot;&gt;Saturday afternoon against Texas&lt;/a&gt; in Austin, as Big 12 conference play begins.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Masek &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-basebl/stats/2012-2013/ttu21.html&quot;&gt;gave up a run&lt;/a&gt; in the first inning to the Longhorns, ending his scoreless pitching streak at 32 innings. However, he quickly resumed his old way, shutting out Texas in the remaining innings he pitched (the second through eighth innings).

With the Miami Heat&#39;s winning streak now at 20 games after last night&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=400278676&quot;&gt;victory in Philadelphia&lt;/a&gt;, I decided to examine LeBron James&#39;s minutes played in each game during the streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As seen in the following graph, I divided the games into those the Heat won by single-digit and double-digit margins. (I included the Heat&#39;s&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=400278565&quot;&gt; double-overtime 141-129 win&lt;/a&gt; over Sacramento as a single-digit game, as the game would have been close down the stretch.) Another factor that may affect James&#39;s (and other NBA stars&#39;) minutes played is opportunity for rest between games. Accordingly, I divided games into three categories: first game of two on back-to-back days; second game of a back-to-back; and at least one off-day before &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; after the game. Here are James&#39;s average minutes played as a function of win-margin and game-scheduling.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yJF9P0TTd08/UUIcsOyl5bI/AAAAAAAACSs/aLceVMNn_4w/s1600/lebron+james+minutes+played.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;320&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yJF9P0TTd08/UUIcsOyl5bI/AAAAAAAACSs/aLceVMNn_4w/s400/lebron+james+minutes+played.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of trends are apparent in the graph. First, if we look at the yellow (off-days before and after) and black (second game of back-to-back) lines, James gets three and one-half extra minutes of rest when the Heat is winning handily. (The difference is even greater for the white line, representing first games of back-to-back situations, but there is only one observation for single-digit games of this type.) Also, regardless of victory margin, James plays about two minutes fewer in second games of back-to-back scenarios than in games surrounded by off-days.&amp;nbsp; </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/2785597786193144330/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=2785597786193144330&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2785597786193144330'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2785597786193144330'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/lebron-jamess-minutes-played-during.html' title='LeBron James&#39;s Minutes Played During Heat Streak'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-yJF9P0TTd08/UUIcsOyl5bI/AAAAAAAACSs/aLceVMNn_4w/s72-c/lebron+james+minutes+played.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-8332285319462335698</id><published>2013-03-11T12:04:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2013-03-11T12:10:57.412-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Heat Wave Has Miami Winning Streak at 18 Games</title><content type='html'>The Miami Heat won its &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=400278658&quot;&gt;18th straight game&lt;/a&gt; last night, routing the Indiana Pacers, 105-91. Among all-time win streaks, Miami now &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/12/bobcats-end-losing-streak-clippers-seek.html&quot;&gt;ties for the seventh-longest&lt;/a&gt; in NBA history and eclipses a 17-game run by the Los Angeles Clippers earlier this season. The second-longest all-time NBA win streak, &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2008/03/houston-rockets-extended-their-winning.html&quot;&gt;22 games by the 2007-08 Houston Rockets&lt;/a&gt;, is certainly within reach, whereas it will take something extra special for the Heat to approach the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers&#39; NBA record 33-game winning streak.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though a comparison to the Lakers&#39; record is admittedly premature, I find it instructive to compare their margins of victories during the 1971-72 streak to Miami&#39;s during its current run. By routing opponents, a team can rest its star players, keeping them fresh for the long grind of a streak. As I documented in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2007/01/today-is-35th-anniversary-of-ending-of.html&quot;&gt;retrospective on the Lakers&#39; streak&lt;/a&gt;, they won 23 of the 33 games (70%)&amp;nbsp; by double-digits. As shown in the following little chart that I made, the Heat has won 10 of the 18 games in its streak by double-digits (56%).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-N5HDnD9VARY/UT4WyxYKylI/AAAAAAAACSc/1yZApCsEh7c/s1600/miami+heat+18+game+winning+streak.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;352&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-N5HDnD9VARY/UT4WyxYKylI/AAAAAAAACSc/1yZApCsEh7c/s400/miami+heat+18+game+winning+streak.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As a further sign of how little the 1971-72 Lakers were challenged during their streak, they won 32 of the 33 games in the streak by four points or more in regulation; the one exception was an overtime game. Miami has had two close calls: a &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=400278623&quot;&gt;one-point win over Orlando&lt;/a&gt; (97-96) on March 6 when LeBron James made a layup in the final seconds and a Feb. 26 &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=400278565&quot;&gt;double-overtime game&lt;/a&gt; against Sacramento, which the Heat ultimately won handily, 141-129 (Heat &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/team/schedule/_/name/mia/miami-heat&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Looking at the near term, Miami&#39;s next five opponents are the teams that rank 6-10 in the Eastern Conference &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/standings&quot;&gt;standings&lt;/a&gt; (winning percentages in parentheses):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tuesday, March 12, vs.  Atlanta (.548)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wednesday, March 13, at Philadelphia&amp;nbsp; (.371)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Friday, March 15, at Milwaukee (.525)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Sunday, March 17, at Toronto (.391)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Monday, March 18, at Boston (.548)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A sweep of these five games would give the Heat 23 straight wins and the second-longest win streak in NBA history. Although none of the NBA&#39;s elite teams of the current season (e.g., Oklahoma City, San Antonio) appear during this upcoming stretch, there are three reasons for Miami fans to be concerned: five games in seven days make for a tiring stretch, four of the games are on the road, and the Heat and Celtics have an intense rivalry, going back to last season&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/boston/nba/story/_/id/8032543/2012-nba-playoffs-boston-celtics-deal-abrupt-end-loss-miami-heat&quot;&gt;seven-game conference finals&lt;/a&gt;, so you know Boston will be ready a week from today!</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/8332285319462335698/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=8332285319462335698&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8332285319462335698'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8332285319462335698'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/heat-wave-has-miami-winning-streak-at.html' title='Heat Wave Has Miami Winning Streak at 18 Games'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-N5HDnD9VARY/UT4WyxYKylI/AAAAAAAACSc/1yZApCsEh7c/s72-c/miami+heat+18+game+winning+streak.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-7719602835255069940</id><published>2013-03-09T22:30:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2013-03-09T22:30:58.321-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Blackhawks&#39; Undefeated Streak in Regulation Time Comes to End</title><content type='html'>The Chicago Blackhawks&#39; season-opening streak of 24 games without a regulation-time loss &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nhl/recap?gameId=400442827&quot;&gt;ended last night&lt;/a&gt; in a 6-2 defeat at Colorado. (NHL teams normally would have played more than 24 games by now, but the current season was shortened by an owners&#39; lockout.) During these 24 games, the Blackhawks won 14 games in regulation and seven games after the regulation 60 minutes ended in a tie (either in the five-minute sudden-death overtime period or in a shootout after a scoreless OT). Chicago also lost three games in shootouts after tying in regulation (click &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/schedule/_/name/chi/chicago-blackhawks&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for Hawks&#39; 2013 game-by-game log).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In fact, Chicago finished the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nhl/team/schedule/_/name/chi/year/2012/chicago-blackhawks&quot;&gt;2011-12 regular season&lt;/a&gt; with no regulation losses in its final six games, putting the combined-season streak at 30 games.

&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: verdana,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10px; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quackit.com/html/html_table_tutorial.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;HTML Tables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Typically, teams that go on long streaks of success blow away most of their opponents -- a sign of their superior talent and coaching -- and perhaps rely on luck in a few games to keep their streaks alive. One example is the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers, who &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2007/01/today-is-35th-anniversary-of-ending-of.html&quot;&gt;won 33 straight&lt;/a&gt; NBA basketball games. Other than one overtime game, the Lakers always won by at least four points during the streak. Further, 23 of the 33 wins were by double digits.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Although a direct comparison of basketball and hockey is necessarily imprecise, the Blackhawks clearly did not annihilate many opponents during their 30-game regulation undefeated streak. In only eight of the 30 games did regulation play end with Chicago ahead by two or more goals. Counting only regulation time during the 30 games, the Blackhawks averaged 2.90 goals per game, whereas their opponents averaged 1.93, a difference of less than a goal per game. In this way, Chicago&#39;s streak was an unusual one. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/7719602835255069940/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=7719602835255069940&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7719602835255069940'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7719602835255069940'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/03/blackhawks-undefeated-streak-in.html' title='Blackhawks&#39; Undefeated Streak in Regulation Time Comes to End'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-8092480058240359996</id><published>2013-02-06T11:10:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2013-02-10T21:32:51.337-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Hot 3-Point Shooting in Houston and Ann Arbor</title><content type='html'>Three-point shots were flying through the nets in Houston, Texas, and Ann Arbor, Michigan, last night.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In H-town, it was the NBA Rockets hitting 23-of-40 (57.5%) from beyond the arc, in a 140-109 rout of Golden State. Interestingly, every Rocket player who attempted at least one trey hit at a .500 or higher clip from downtown (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?id=400278438&quot;&gt;box score&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;James Harden, 4-of-5&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Jeremy Lin, 5-of-8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Chandler Parsons, 4-of-8&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Marcus Morris, 3-of-6&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Toney Douglas, 2-of-4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;James Anderson, 2-of-4&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patrick Patterson, 1-of-2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Patrick Beverley, 1-of-2&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Donatas Motiejunas, 1-of-1&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;strike&gt;I don&#39;t know if an NBA team has ever before had each of its players make half or more of his three-point attempts in the same game, but I doubt it&#39;s very common! &lt;/strike&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even more surprisingly, according to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/recap?id=400278438&quot;&gt;game article&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;The Rockets put on the shooting display without their best 3-point shooter -- Carlos Delfino sat out with a right elbow injury.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: #b45f06;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I have since discovered that on March 13, 2005, when Toronto hit 21 from downtown (61.8%, on 34 attempts) vs. Philly, &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/boxscore?gameId=250313028&quot;&gt;all Raptors who attempted a shot were .500+&lt;/a&gt;. These include: Donyell Marshall, 12-of-19; Morris Peterson, 4-of-6; Rafer Alston, 2-of-3; Jalen Rose, 2-of-4; and Matt Bonner, 1-of-2. Also, the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nba.com/history/records/regular_3ptfg.html&quot;&gt;NBA&#39;s online record book&lt;/a&gt; lists &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basketball-reference.com/boxscores/199501200IND.html&quot;&gt;Indiana as going 7-of-7&lt;/a&gt; vs.  Atlanta on January 20, 1995, for most three-point field goals without a  miss in a game. Reggie Miller went 4-of-4, Haywoode Workman, 1-of-1, and  Byron Scott, 2-of-2. What the 2013 Rockets and 2005 Raptors did on a  lot more attempts is arguably more impressive than the Pacers&#39; 7-of-7, I would say.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Meanwhile, up in Ann Arbor, Tim Hardaway, Jr., and his Michigan Wolverine teammates came roaring out of the locker room to begin the second half and made their first eight trey attempts of the period against Ohio State. UM&#39;s only three-point miss of the second half came on a potential game-winner at the buzzer, but the Wolverines prevailed in overtime, 76-74 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330360130&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As seen in this screen-capture of ESPN.com&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/playbyplay?gameId=330360130&quot;&gt;play-by-play sheet&lt;/a&gt; (which I highlighted), Hardaway made four straight second-half threes within a 3:19 span (from between 12:04 and 8:45 left in the game).

The stretch propelled the Gators to No. 2 in the nation. However, a horrible first half at Arkansas doomed Florida in an 80-69 &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330360008&quot;&gt;streak-ending loss&lt;/a&gt;.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/8092480058240359996/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=8092480058240359996&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8092480058240359996'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8092480058240359996'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/02/hot-3-point-shooting-in-houston-and-ann.html' title='Hot 3-Point Shooting in Houston and Ann Arbor'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dxUySH-P02Q/URKnjk0gzKI/AAAAAAAACRc/9jPtbPqxRZY/s72-c/hardaway+treys.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-2491318029176351047</id><published>2013-02-02T15:13:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2013-02-02T15:16:26.030-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Hot Hand Meta-Analysis Published</title><content type='html'>The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/14690292/14/1&quot;&gt;January 2013 issue&lt;/a&gt; of the journal &lt;i&gt;Psychology of Sport and Exercise&lt;/i&gt; contains a meta-analysis of hot hand studies, conducted by Simcha Avugos, Jörn Köppen, Uwe Czienskowski, Markus Raab, and Michael Bar-Eli. The authors located 22 articles providing tests of the hot hand (i.e., success begets success, and failure begets failure) in a variety of sports. Because some articles included multiple studies, there were 56 effect sizes in all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Results from each study were converted to a common correlational metric. The closer an effect size was to +1, the more supportive the study was of the hot hand (i.e., how an athlete performed on one trial is likely to be replicated on the next trial). Effect sizes close to -1, in contrast, convey the opposite of the hot hand (i.e., how an athlete performed on one trial is likely to be followed by an opposite result on the next trial). A zero effect-size doesn&#39;t support either trend.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The average effect size was .02, leading the authors to conclude that, &quot;...we found no&lt;br /&gt;solid evidence for either the existence of a general hot hand effect, or for any moderating variable that can explain the extent of a hot hand effect&quot; (p. 26).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/2491318029176351047/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=2491318029176351047&amp;isPopup=true' title='1 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2491318029176351047'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2491318029176351047'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/02/hot-hand-meta-analysis-published.html' title='Hot Hand Meta-Analysis Published'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>1</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-4566031160772337776</id><published>2013-01-28T12:21:00.004-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-28T12:37:29.668-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Northern Illinois&#39;s Shooting Goes South</title><content type='html'>Northern Illinois University&#39;s men&#39;s basketball team got a lot of attention this past Saturday -- and not the kind that a team covets. The Huskies lost to Eastern Michigan by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330262199&quot;&gt;42-25 score&lt;/a&gt;. The score alone conveys NIU&#39;s offensive woes, but the details are even worse:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only four points scored in the first half.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only one shot from the floor made in 31 attempts in the first half.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Only one three-point shot made in the entire contest out of 33 attempts.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;I had not followed Northern Illinois at all this season, before Saturday&#39;s game. I was therefore curious whether the horrendous shooting against Eastern Michigan was just a &quot;one-off&quot; by an otherwise good shooting team, or part of a pattern this season. As shown in the following chart that I made from NIU&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/schedule/_/id/2459/northern-illinois-huskies&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;, the answer is the latter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;

Quoting from this &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330192459&quot;&gt;game article&lt;/a&gt;,  the Huskies&#39; 34 points constituted their &quot;lowest point total since  losing 61-31 to Southern Illinois in 1946.&quot; Then, just two games later,  against Eastern Michigan, NIU took its offensive futility to a new (low)  level, scoring just 25 points. To find that small of an offensive NIU  output, one has to go back to January 11, 1941, when the Huskies lost at  Chicago Normal (now Chicago State) 26-25 (see last year&#39;s NIU &lt;a href=&quot;http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/niu/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/1112-info-guide.pdf&quot;&gt;media guide&lt;/a&gt; for detailed game-by-game information throughout program history).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Interestingly, in between the WMU and EMU games, NIU got a rare win, &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330232117&quot;&gt;topping Central Michigan&lt;/a&gt;, 74-61. In racking up a healthy point total, the Huskies shot an impressive.526 on three-point attempts (10-of-19). This outburst from behind the arc, along with one in a Jan. 9 &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=330090193&quot;&gt;win over Miami (Ohio)&lt;/a&gt; in which the Huskies shot .692 from long distance (9-of-13), are clearly the exceptions. In 15 out of NIU&#39;s 18 games thus far this season, the Huskies have shot .333 or lower on three-point attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is also apparent that Northern Illinois is not a good free throw-shooting team, either. In eight of the team&#39;s games, the Huskies have shot .600 or lower from the stripe. To explore the idea of a generalized shooting ability, covering two- and three-point baskets and free throws, I obtained &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_product-moment_correlation_coefficient&quot;&gt;correlation coefficients&lt;/a&gt; between each pair among the three variables. As shown in the following graph (on which you can click to enlarge), free-throw and three-point success were positively correlated, &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; = .46 (the probability of this result occurring by chance was .057, slightly higher than the conventional cut-off of .05, but isn&#39;t bad for such a small sample). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-27P6iOx-DbE/UQbQAOkvZdI/AAAAAAAACQ0/CxO5FBsub7o/s1600/niu+shooting+pct+2012-13.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;355&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-27P6iOx-DbE/UQbQAOkvZdI/AAAAAAAACQ0/CxO5FBsub7o/s400/niu+shooting+pct+2012-13.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In short, the better NIU shot free throws in a game, the better it shot three-pointers (and the worse it did one, the worse it did the other). In a way, this is surprising, because free throws are attempted without the shooter being defended (hence the term &quot;free&quot;), whereas three-point shooters often have opponents in their face.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I&#39;ve circled a bunch of dots in the graph that seem to characterize several NIU shooting nights; in these games, the Huskies&#39; shooting percentages were in the 50s and low 60s on free throws and in the 20s and 30s from downtown. Starting from this relatively low characteristic level of shooting, all it takes is some bad luck or tenacious defense from the opponent to drive the Huskies down to the abysmal shooting they&#39;ve exhibited of late.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The correlation between two-point shooting and free throws, and between two-point and three-point shooting, were both in the positive direction (higher on one, higher on the other), but not close to the .05 level of statistical significance. Because two-point shots can range from slam-dunks to shots just inside the arc, it&#39;s not surprising that their data are somewhat noisy. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/4566031160772337776/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=4566031160772337776&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4566031160772337776'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4566031160772337776'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2013/01/northern-illinoiss-shooting-goes-south.html' title='Northern Illinois&#39;s Shooting Goes South'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-27P6iOx-DbE/UQbQAOkvZdI/AAAAAAAACQ0/CxO5FBsub7o/s72-c/niu+shooting+pct+2012-13.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-3418000075145632701</id><published>2013-01-06T00:49:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2013-01-06T00:52:02.247-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Titans&#39; Unusual Streak of Four Straight Touchdowns</title><content type='html'>Last Sunday, in the final weekend of the NFL&#39;s regular season, the Tennessee Titans scored touchdowns on four straight touches of the ball against the Jacksonville Jaguars, but none of these scores was accomplished by the Titans&#39; offensive unit. I thank my father and brother for bringing this occurrence to my attention. As summarized in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sbnation.com/2012/12/30/3818438/titans-score-28-unanswered-points-without-a-single-offensive-play&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The first touchdown was scored after [Tennessee&#39;s] Zach Brown intercepted [Jacksonville&#39;s] Chad Henne and ran the ball back 79 yards for a defensive touchdown. After the Jaguars offense was forced to punt on their very next possession, the punt was returned 69 yards for another touchdown by Darius Reynaud.  The Jaguars offense once again took the field without a break and once  again they were forced to punt and, once again, Darius Reynaud returned  the punt for a touchdown, this time for 81 yards. Finally, the last  touchdown was scored on another Zach Brown pick six, this time from 30  yards out.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In the remainder of this posting, I will estimate the probability of the Titans&#39; achievement. First, what is the likelihood of two interception returns for touchdowns (also known as &quot;pick sixes&quot;) &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt; two punt returns for touchdowns occurring in the same game? (At this stage, we&#39;re not taking into account that all four touchdowns were scored by the same team and done consecutively.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &quot;Fifth Down&quot; blog in the &lt;i&gt;New York Times&lt;/i&gt; just happened to have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://fifthdown.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/quirks-of-the-game-the-rise-of-the-pick-six/&quot;&gt;write-up on pick sixes&lt;/a&gt; the other day, which provided the following statistics on this past NFL season:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;17,788 passes were attempted.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;71 of these passes were intercepted and brought back for touchdowns (an NFL record for one season).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Based on these figures, the ratio of attempted passes that ended up as pick sixes was .004 (4-in-1,000 or 1-in-250).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We need the same kind of statistics on punt returns and, fortunately, they are &lt;a href=&quot;http://aol.sportingnews.com/nfl/statistics/team/returning/sort/punt_return_touchdowns/2012&quot;&gt;readily available&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;There were 1,133 punt returns in the NFL this past seasons (excluding fair catches, in which the returner raises his hand to signal that he will not run with the ball after catching it, in exchange for not being clobbered).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;18 punt returns resulted in touchdowns.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The TD ratio is thus .016, a little over 1-per-100.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To estimate the probability of two pick sixes and two punt-return TDs in one game, we multiply together:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;.004 X .004 X .016 X .016 = .000000004 or 4-in-1 billion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(This calculation assumes &lt;i&gt;independence of observations&lt;/i&gt;, that the outcome of any one play had no effect on the other plays, akin to coin tosses. However, there could be common causes amongst the plays, such as the Jaguars&#39; offensive and special-teams players being poor tacklers.) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Next, let&#39;s tackle the issue of all four of these touchdowns being scored by Tennessee, instead of say, two by Tennessee and two by Jacksonville, or three by one team and one by the other. Let&#39;s assume, for each of the touchdowns, that it was just as likely Jacksonville could have scored it as Tennessee (i.e., a coin flip). The probability of the Titans winning all four coin flips, if you will, is 1/16. Multiplying our previous value of .000000004 by .0625 yields .00000000025 or 2.5-in-10 billion.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, four touchdowns by the same team, via two interceptions and two punt returns, would not necessarily have to occur in four consecutive possessions by the victimized team. Here is a screen-capture of ESPN.com&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nfl/drivechart?gameId=321230010&quot;&gt;drive chart&lt;/a&gt; for the Jaguars vs. the Titans.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lnXpmAGMIVo/UOkvqKL2GII/AAAAAAAACQg/N3r8W3lxiSE/s1600/titans+4+tds+vs+jax.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;283&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-lnXpmAGMIVo/UOkvqKL2GII/AAAAAAAACQg/N3r8W3lxiSE/s400/titans+4+tds+vs+jax.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The four drives leading to Tennessee touchdowns are denoted with blue arrows. Note also that Jacksonville&#39;s drive beginning with 33 seconds left in the first half is excluded, as there was little remaining time for anything major to happen. We are thus left with 12 Jacksonville possessions, with Tennessee&#39;s non-offensive touchdowns occurring on drives 5, 6, 7, and 8. There are many possible combinations of drives on which the four Titans&#39; TDs could have occurred, nine of which are consecutive (e.g., 1-2-3-4, 2-3-4-5, ..., 9-10-11-12), and many additional others that are non-consecutive (e.g., 1-4-9-10, 4-6-9-11).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The total number of possible combinations can be obtained via the &lt;i&gt;n-choose-k&lt;/i&gt; principle, in this case raising the question of how many ways can four drives (&lt;i&gt;k&lt;/i&gt;) be selected from 12 total drives (&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;). Using this &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.math.sc.edu/cgi-bin/sumcgi/calculator.pl/&quot;&gt;online calculator&lt;/a&gt;, we learn that there are 495 possible ways to select four objects from a total of 12. Nine of these sets are consecutive, as noted above. The probability of the four TDs occurring on four consecutive drives is thus 9/495 or .018.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;We thus multiply our previous interim probability of .00000000025 by .018, yielding .0000000000045. This translates to roughly &lt;b&gt;4.5-in-1 trillion&lt;/b&gt;. Suffice it to say, we are unlikely to see anything like this ever again. The funny thing is, as shown in the above drive chart, Tennessee intercepted a Jacksonville pass on the Jaguars&#39; next drive following the four touchdowns, but the interceptor didn&#39;t make a touchdown on the return. Therefore, we possibly could have had &lt;i&gt;five&lt;/i&gt; consecutive non-offensive TDs by Tennessee.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &quot;Game notes&quot; at the bottom of this &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=321230010&quot;&gt;ESPN.com article&lt;/a&gt; on the Jacksonville-Tennessee game cited two similar occurrences to what Tennessee pulled off: &quot;The Titans also had three return touchdowns Sept. 23 in an overtime win  over Detroit. Reynaud had a 105-yard kickoff return in that game [&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=320923010&amp;amp;period=0&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;]. ...  The Seahawks had four interception returns for TDs on Nov. 4, 1984,  against Kansas City in a 45-0 rout, and three different players scored  those TDs [&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/198411040sea.htm&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;].&quot; I checked the records from these games and in neither case were the return touchdowns all consecutive.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As noted throughout, the above calculations have required several simplifying assumptions. Also, it&#39;s certainly possible that I made a calculation or logical error somewhere along the way.

The Clippers are off until a Tuesday night game at Denver, whereas the Bobcats played this afternoon at Chicago.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking this morning that Charlotte&#39;s losing streak was likely to be extended in Chicago, I began work on the following chart to track how far the Clippers would rise in the annals of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_National_Basketball_Association_longest_winning_streaks&quot;&gt;all-time NBA winning streaks&lt;/a&gt; and how far the Bobcats would fall in the ranks of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_NBA_losing_streaks&quot;&gt;all-time NBA losing streaks&lt;/a&gt;.

After the Bulls had rallied to tie the game 65-65 after three quarters, Chicago proceeded to miss its first six field-goal attempts of the fourth quarter as Charlotte took a 75-65 lead.

Below, I&#39;ve plotted the Vols&#39; three-point shooting percentages in each of their games thus far (&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/schedule/_/id/2633/tennessee-volunteers&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;).

From there, things went downhill, with the exception of the Vols&#39; ninth game, against Presbyterian.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Two games in particular in which Tennessee&#39;s offense entered the deep freeze were those against Georgetown and Virginia. In &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=323350046&quot;&gt;losing to Georgetown&lt;/a&gt; by a 37-36 score, the Vols not only had a bad outing on threes, but also struggled horribly on free throws (3-of-11). Then, against Virginia, Tennessee scored &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=323400258&quot;&gt;only 38 points&lt;/a&gt;, losing 46-38.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At this point, the Volunteers have shot .200 or below from downtown in five of their last six games. As of this writing, Tennessee is &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/statistics/team/_/stat/3-points/sort/threePointFieldGoalPct/count/281&quot;&gt;tied for 317th&lt;/a&gt; out of 347 in the nation in three-point shooting percentage (.280, 51/182).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In a situation like this, one might ask whether, perhaps, Tennessee had a good three-point shooter get injured after the first few games. That does not appear to be the case. In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=323142633&quot;&gt;opener vs. Kennesaw State&lt;/a&gt;, for example, guards Skylar McBee (4-of-7) and Jordan McRae (3-of-4) shot well from behind the arc. Both have played in &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/team/stats/_/id/2633/tennessee-volunteers&quot;&gt;all 11 of the Vols&#39; games&lt;/a&gt; thus far this season.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/7654559458017519841/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=7654559458017519841&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7654559458017519841'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7654559458017519841'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/12/tennessee-mens-three-point-shooting.html' title='Tennessee Men&#39;s Three-Point Shooting Crashes!'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Dgg-XjnNLYE/UOEFTiWKJgI/AAAAAAAACP4/P9CScBzOqxo/s72-c/tennessee+mens+3pt.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-4972732183549800077</id><published>2012-12-27T20:59:00.001-08:00</published><updated>2012-12-29T14:40:58.928-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Texas Tech Football Defense Not Getting Takeaways</title><content type='html'>As Texas Tech&#39;s football team heads into its &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/122712aab.html&quot;&gt;bowl game&lt;/a&gt; Friday night against Minnesota, the Gophers have to be fairly confident about not getting the ball swiped when they&#39;re on offense. As I learned yesterday from a local &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.doublet1043.com/&quot;&gt;radio sports station&lt;/a&gt;, the Tech defense has not registered a takeaway (i.e., defensive fumble recovery or interception) in its last five games.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That seemed to me like a long dry spell, but whenever one hears a number (in this case, the Red Raiders&#39; five straight takeaway-free games), he or she should always ask, &quot;Compared to what?&quot; To answer this question, I examined the statistics for all Big 12 games this year to see how often other conference teams went takeaway-free.

The Red Raiders had one other takeaway-free game earlier (against West Virginia) for a total of six. The next closest team to Texas Tech in not purloining the ball was Baylor, who had three straight games (and three total) sans takeaway. At the other extreme, Kansas State took the ball away in all of its Big 12 games, for zero takeaway-free games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Tommy Tuberville, who coached the Red Raiders during the regular season before bolting for Cincinnati, &lt;a href=&quot;http://redraiders.com/sports-red-raiders-football/2012-11-25/turnover-disparity-heart-techs-second-half-slide#.UN0l2XewV40&quot;&gt;speculated in this article&lt;/a&gt; that, &quot;I think we set a national record of six games without a [defensive] turnover...&quot; However, the article could not pinpoint whether the five-game streak was an NCAA record.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; After failing for roughly 59 minutes of their bowl game to get a takeaway, the Red Raiders &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/recaps/122912aab.html&quot;&gt;intercepted a Minnesota pass&lt;/a&gt; in the final minute to set up the game-winning field-goal, as Texas Tech won 34-31 (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.texastech.com/sports/m-footbl/stats/2012-2013/ttu13.html&quot;&gt;stats and play-by-play&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;--- &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*You&#39;ll notice what appear to be a few scheduling oddities. For example, TCU appears in the chart as the second conference opponent for both Baylor and Iowa State. No, the Horned Frogs were not playing at the same time in two games. Baylor and Iowa State each began conference play on September 29. The Cyclones played TCU a week later, on October 6. The Bears had a bye on October 6, so their second conference game was played on October 13, also against TCU.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/4972732183549800077/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=4972732183549800077&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4972732183549800077'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4972732183549800077'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/12/texas-tech-football-defense-not-getting.html' title='Texas Tech Football Defense Not Getting Takeaways'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-4273550756054521810</id><published>2012-12-22T23:47:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-12-22T23:49:05.197-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Sun Devils Scorch Texas Tech on Three-Point Shots</title><content type='html'>I attended Saturday afternoon&#39;s Arizona State at Texas Tech men&#39;s basketball game. The Red Raiders are trying to rebuild with a young coach after a few down seasons and were looking for a win over a major-conference opponent. However, it was not to be, as the Sun Devils put on a three-point shooting exhibition, en route to a 77-62 victory. ASU shot &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/boxscore?gameId=323572641&quot;&gt;14-of-27 (.519) behind the arc&lt;/a&gt; for the game, but did particular damage in the first half.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I have charted the outcomes of ASU&#39;s 17 first-half three-point attempts, of which the Sun Devils made 10, from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncb/playbyplay?gameId=323572641&quot;&gt;play-by-play sheet &lt;/a&gt;.

He came into Lubbock&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/player/gamelog/_/id/56294/jonathan-gilling&quot;&gt; hitting only .358&lt;/a&gt; on threes (24-of-67) for the season. Guard Evan Gordon added four treys in the first half, on six attempts; he went 4-of-7 on the day. He &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/player/gamelog/_/id/45612/evan-gordon&quot;&gt;came in shooting .309&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp; (21-of-68) this season from long distance.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In addition to the Sun Devils&#39; high three-point accuracy rate, the way they produced flurries of treys was impressive. All told, as the chart shows, ASU made seven of its first nine three-point attempts. The first two made threes came less than a minute apart (with 18:14 and 17:31 remaining in the first half). A bit later came a torrent of three treys within less than a minute (between the 16:15 and 15:21 marks). A couple minutes later, Gordon hit a pair 13 seconds apart (13:03 and 12:50).</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/4273550756054521810/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=4273550756054521810&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4273550756054521810'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4273550756054521810'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/12/sun-devils-scorch-texas-tech-with-hot.html' title='Sun Devils Scorch Texas Tech on Three-Point Shots'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-3599454532375204567</id><published>2012-12-14T20:59:00.000-08:00</published><updated>2012-12-16T01:48:14.450-08:00</updated><title type='text'>O.J. Mayo Off to Fast Start on Three-Point Shooting</title><content type='html'>After 22 games this season, &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/player/_/id/3450/o.j.-mayo&quot;&gt;O.J. Mayo&lt;/a&gt; of the Dallas Mavericks is currently hitting three-pointers at a torrid .525 percentage (64-of-122). The New York Knicks&#39; Jason Kidd &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/3-points&quot;&gt;actually leads Mayo slightly&lt;/a&gt; in this statistical category, .527-.525, as of this writing, but Kidd has taken roughly 50 fewer shots than Mayo&amp;nbsp;from downtown. Mayo&#39;s career shooting percentage from behind the arc, based on four seasons with the Memphis Grizzlies before this fall&#39;s arrival in Dallas, is .388. That&#39;s an excellent success rate, but this season he&#39;s taking his outside game to a new level.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In looking at the list of annual &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/nba/statistics/player/_/stat/3-points&quot;&gt;NBA leaders in three-point shooting percentage&lt;/a&gt;, there have been some players who have managed to maintain a hit rate of .500 or greater for a full season. Most recently, Kyle Korver shot .536 (59-of-110) from long-distance during the 2009–10 season and Jason Kapono,    .514 (108-210) in 2006–07. However, these percentages were achieved on a lot fewer shots than Mayo&amp;nbsp;would be&amp;nbsp;projected to take over the entire season (roughly 450), based on his shots per game thus far. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taking number of shots into account, arguably the most impressive three-point shooting season since the NBA introduced the trey in 1979-80 was by Glen Rice in 1996-97, when he shot .470 (207-of-440). Whether Mayo can surpass Rice&#39;s percentage -- or better yet .500 -- over a comparable number of attempts, of course, remains to be seen.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Periodically, I&#39;ll track Mayo&#39;s progress toward a .500 season on three-point shots. Below are two graphs I made, the first looking at Mayo&#39;s game-specific three-point shooting and the second looking at his cumulative percentage. (You may click on the graphics to enlarge them.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kIUEaxZIE4U/UMv33-N51CI/AAAAAAAACOk/lMB1qK1i0EQ/s1600/oj+mayo+game+by+game.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;390&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-kIUEaxZIE4U/UMv33-N51CI/AAAAAAAACOk/lMB1qK1i0EQ/s400/oj+mayo+game+by+game.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The first graph shows that Mayo hit 50% or more of his three-point attempts in 11 of his first 12 games this season, the only exception being a 1-for-3 outing against Washington in Game 9. He then went into a brief slump, including three games in which he missed all of his attempts from behind the arc (.000 percentages). Lately, however, he&#39;s gotten pretty hot again.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y0AKrBnBJTo/UMv1YZtLs9I/AAAAAAAACOc/5SOmpT9UGPM/s1600/oj+mayo+cumulative.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;337&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Y0AKrBnBJTo/UMv1YZtLs9I/AAAAAAAACOc/5SOmpT9UGPM/s400/oj+mayo+cumulative.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The second graph shows his cumulative three-point shooting perecentage after each game. Let&#39;s focus first on the blue curve, which presents&amp;nbsp;Mayo&#39;s actual raw data.&amp;nbsp;Mayo went 2-for-4 in the opening game, hence the blue curve is at .500 on the vertical axis. He then shot&amp;nbsp;3-for-5 in the second game, giving him a combined 5 made threes on 9 attempts, for a cumulative percentage of .556 after two games. His peak cumulative three-point shooting percentage thus far came after four games, at .667 (18-for-27).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The red curve in the second graph represents a &quot;smoothing out&quot; of the trend to avoid slight game-to-game fluctuations and focus on the larger picture.* The smoothed curve makes it clear that Mayo has settled into a cumulative&amp;nbsp;shooting percentage of roughly .52 over his last several games (in contrast to the blue, raw-data curve, which shows some slight fluctuations above and below .52 over the same span of games). Another point worth noting is that, as the season moves along and Mayo&#39;s cumulative shooting percentage reflects increasing numbers of shots, his performance in any one game (or small set of games) will have less and less&amp;nbsp;effect.**&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;----------&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;*TECHNICAL POINT: The official name of the smoothing technique is &lt;i&gt;loess&lt;/i&gt; (also known as &lt;i&gt;lowess&lt;/i&gt;) regression, which refers to &quot;local&quot; estimation in different segments of the sequence. Further information on the technique is available &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loess_regression&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://peltiertech.com/WordPress/loess-smoothing-in-excel/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; (the second article links to a free downloadable&amp;nbsp;Excel&amp;nbsp;add-on to do loess regression). Loess regression requires the user to submit a value for what is called the &quot;smoothing parameter.&quot; With a low value, such as .25, the smoothed curve really does not get too smoothed out at all, closely following the twists and turns of the data (i.e., the loess curve is highly sensitive to tiny changes in the trend being plotted). In contrast, a smoothing parameter of 1.0 generates essentially a straight line, showing very little sensitivity to small ups-and-downs in the raw data. I ultimately chose a .50 smoothing parameter, which is at the high end of what the Excel software add-on said was the typical range.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;**UPDATE: In the Mavericks&#39; 23rd game of the season, tonight at Toronto, neither Mayo nor any of his Dallas teammates made a three-pointer. Quoting from the &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/nba/recap?gameId=400278045&quot;&gt;game article&lt;/a&gt;: &quot;The Mavericks went 0 for 13 from 3-point range, coming up empty for the  first time since February 1999. Their stretch of 1,108 games had been  the longest active streak in the NBA.&quot;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/3599454532375204567/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=3599454532375204567&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3599454532375204567'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3599454532375204567'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/12/after-22-games-this-season-o.html' title='O.J.

After all, if you&#39;re 6-foot-11 and one of the great players of the NBA&#39;s modern era, getting one rebound (or more) in a game is not that difficult.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However, when the Boston Celtics&#39; Kevin Garnett failed to get a single rebound against the Philadelphia 76ers this past Saturday, according to &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/blog/boston/celtics/post/_/id/4699915/kg-incredulous-about-zero-rebounds&quot;&gt;ESPN Boston&lt;/a&gt;, he &quot;was shut out on the glass for the first time since Jan. 21, 1997 -- when he was a mere 20 years old.&quot; Garnett only played 23 minutes out of a possible 48 against Philly, thus hindering his chances for a rebound somewhat. Nevertheless, the streak is over, as I learned today watching ESPN&#39;s show &quot;Around the Horn.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Though we know that Garnett went nearly 16 years between rebound-less games, I could not find any articles that gave the exact number of consecutive games in which he had secured at least one rebound. Thanks to the abundant resources at Basketball Reference, I was able to answer this question without too much difficulty. One can simply go to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/g/garneke01.html&quot;&gt;page on Garnett&lt;/a&gt;, scroll down a bit until a grey horizontal links bar appears, and then click on &quot;Game Logs.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There, I found that KG had pulled down at least one board in his final 42 games of 1996-97. Next, I needed to find out how many games Garnett had played in each season from 1997-98 to 2011-12, as we know he got a rebound in each game he played during that span. Finally, I ascertained that Garnett had gotten at least one rebound in his first 19 games of 2012-13, before being shut out vs. the 76ers. Here are all the consecutive games in which Garnett had gotten a rebound.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bordercolor=&quot;#0066CC&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #339933; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: left;&quot;&gt; &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;1996-97: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;42&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2002-03: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2008-09: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;57&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;1997-98: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2003-04: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2009-10: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;69&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;1998-99: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;47&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2004-05: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;82&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2010-11: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;71&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;1999-00: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;81&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2005-06: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;76&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2011-12: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;60&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2000-01: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;81&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2006-07: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;76&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2012-13: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;19&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2001-02: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;81&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;2007-08: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;71&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: white;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;background-color: #444444;&quot;&gt;TOTAL: &lt;span style=&quot;color: yellow;&quot;&gt;1,159&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: verdana,arial,sans-serif; font-size: 10px;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.quackit.com/html/html_table_tutorial.cfm&quot; target=&quot;_top&quot;&gt;HTML Tables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Garnett thus had grabbed at least one rebound in 1,159 straight games. No wonder he was exasperated (seemingly in a humorous way) after the Philly game upon learning he had come up empty on the boards. This &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cbssports.com/nba/blog/eye-on-basketball/21325961/celtics-kevin-garnett-doesnt-record-a-rebound-but-does-record-a-fun-rant&quot;&gt;page&lt;/a&gt; has videos of both Garnett&#39;s post-game statement (warning: salty language) and the play on which Garnett claimed he should have been credited with a rebound. Unfortunately for KG, a teammate pulled the rebound away from him!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Another thing to note from the above chart is Garnett&#39;s durability.

Last night, however, Jack Taylor of Iowa&#39;s Grinnell College took things to a new level, scoring an &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/story/_/id/8658462/jack-taylor-grinnell-drops-138-points-collegiate-scoring-record&quot;&gt;unfathomable 138 points&lt;/a&gt; in an NCAA Division III (small-school) win over Faith Baptist Bible, 179-104. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Now, Grinnell&#39;s style of play is conducive to the launching of lots of shots. A year ago, another Grinnell player &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/espn/commentary/story/_/page/howard-111125/griffin-lentsch-record-89-points-grinnell-college-were-all-part-plan&quot;&gt;scored 89&lt;/a&gt; in a game. But Taylor scored nearly 50 points more than that 89! According to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/127759-systems-check-checking-in-on-the-system-at-grinnell&quot;&gt;2009 profile&lt;/a&gt; of the team&#39;s offensive approach:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;Grinnell coach David Arseneault employs a scheme known only as “The System.” Sometimes referred to as the anti-Princeton offense, “The System” emphasizes a torrid pace of play where offensive possesions last about 5 seconds and typically end with a three-pointer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Grinnell defense is a chaotic, full-court trap that either forces an immediate turnover or degenerates into [an offensive advantage for the other team].&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;It’s so chaotic, Arseneault has to use platoons, substituting all five players every 45 seconds to keep legs fresh.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Taylor&#39;s shooting statistics from last night break down as follows: 25-of-37 on two-point attempts; 27-of-71 on three-point attempts; and 7-of-10 on free throws. He played 36 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;From a hot-hand perspective, the question is whether Taylor actually &quot;got hot&quot; or whether his gigantic point total resulted simply from a mediocre shooting percentage on a huge number of shots (108). I would say it&#39;s some of both.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let&#39;s focus on Taylor&#39;s three-point attempts, as the distance of the shots is held relatively constant and long-distance shots get the crowd excited. Based on the &lt;a href=&quot;http://pioneers.grinnell.edu/boxscore.aspx?id=575&quot;&gt;box score and play-by-play sheet&lt;/a&gt; from the game, here are his shooting sequences behind the arc in the first and second half (H = hit, M = miss; shots are grouped into sets of five to simplify viewing):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;1st half (9-of-32)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;MMMMM&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;MMMM&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;MM&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;M&amp;nbsp; M&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;HH&lt;/span&gt;MM&amp;nbsp; M&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;HHH&lt;/span&gt;M&amp;nbsp; M&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;MMM&amp;nbsp; MM&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;2nd half (18-of-39)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;MMM&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;H&amp;nbsp; H&lt;/span&gt;MMM&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp; M&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;MMM&amp;nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;M&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;HH&lt;/span&gt;M&amp;nbsp; MMMMM&amp;nbsp; M&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;H&lt;/span&gt;MM&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;H&amp;nbsp; H&lt;/span&gt;M&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;HHH&amp;nbsp; HHHH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As shown, for most of the game, Taylor was not hitting more than one or two straight. Any long streaks were of &lt;i&gt;misses&lt;/i&gt;. However, to close the game, Taylor hit his last seven three-pointers in a row.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using this &lt;a href=&quot;http://home.ubalt.edu/ntsbarsh/Business-stat/otherapplets/Randomness.htm&quot;&gt;online calculator&lt;/a&gt;, I conducted a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wald-Wolfowitz_runs_test&quot;&gt;runs test&lt;/a&gt; to detect possible streakiness in Taylor&#39;s second-half shooting (I didn&#39;t think there would be any in the first half). Each consecutive sequence of hits or misses is considered a &quot;run.&quot; The hit to open the second half is one run. The stretch of three straight misses is a second run. The following two straight hits form a third run, etc. Streakiness is characterized by &lt;i&gt;few&lt;/i&gt; runs (i.e., staying in long &quot;grooves&quot; of hitting or missing), as compared to what could be generated at random. Here is a screen capture of the results (on which you may click to enlarge; 1 = hit, 0 = miss):&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A2hv0kmuNXU/UK0nJnGtmyI/AAAAAAAACKs/9uNVCsLS9Ew/s1600/grinnell+runs+test.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;280&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A2hv0kmuNXU/UK0nJnGtmyI/AAAAAAAACKs/9uNVCsLS9Ew/s400/grinnell+runs+test.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;There were 17 runs, which are too many in this context for there to be streakiness. The associated probability (&lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;) level tells us further that there is a 13% chance that a random process (e.g., flipping a coin and looking for runs of heads and tails) could have generated Taylor&#39;s second-half sequence of hits and misses from three-point land. Under statistical convention, we would need this probability to be 5% or less (i.e., &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; &amp;lt; .05).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One thing that I found really interesting about Taylor&#39;s final burst of seven straight successful three-pointers is the &lt;i&gt;quickness&lt;/i&gt; of the barrage. Below is a screen capture of the play-by-play sheet, to which I&#39;ve added red arrows to identify Taylor&#39;s made threes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q1NhKt5JDIE/UK0sXCQmeuI/AAAAAAAACLA/laReRklJvKQ/s1600/grinnell+play-by-play.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;258&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Q1NhKt5JDIE/UK0sXCQmeuI/AAAAAAAACLA/laReRklJvKQ/s400/grinnell+play-by-play.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you click on the graphic, you&#39;ll see that Taylor&#39;s seven hits all occurred within roughly two minutes of game time (from 3:54 remaining to 1:57). Several times, either a Grinnell steal or a Faith Baptist Bible layup was followed within 3 to 10 seconds later by a Taylor trey.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In my book, I discuss a late-game barrage by Iowa&#39;s Justin Johnson, who made six three-pointers in the final 1:56 against Indiana in 2008 to bring his team within two points.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The fact that Grinnell&#39;s game against FBB was not close raises another issue, namely the propriety of continuing to launch three-pointers in the closing minutes when leading by roughly 60 points. The desire to let Taylor finish his performance for the ages is understandable. One could argue, however, that it might have been better for Grinnell to start dribbling out the clock once Taylor had surpassed the previous college record of 116 points.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/3820363290608455397/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=3820363290608455397&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3820363290608455397'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3820363290608455397'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/11/grinnell-colleges-jack-taylor-scores.html' title='Grinnell College&#39;s Jack Taylor Scores a Whopping 138 Points in a Single Game!'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-A2hv0kmuNXU/UK0nJnGtmyI/AAAAAAAACKs/9uNVCsLS9Ew/s72-c/grinnell+runs+test.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-1140724607159589265</id><published>2012-10-20T16:44:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-20T16:45:58.031-07:00</updated><title type='text'>The &quot;Imperfect Casino&quot; Analogy to Hot Hand Perceptions: A Guest Contribution by Mark Lloyd</title><content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;Mark Lloyd of Seattle, Washington recently e-mailed me the following essay of his. I invited him to let me post it here on the blog as a guest contribution, and he agreed. Here it is, with light editing.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A couple of years ago I wrote a computer program simulating a basketball team with players&#39; shooting percentages varying on different days according to distributions with a mean of 50 percent, but with different variances. I then tested the strategy of  giving the ball to players who made two shots in a row compared to giving the ball to players randomly. In the long term giving the ball to the hot hand was a winning strategy.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thinking about this recently I came up with an analogy that makes clear the  difference between the casino and hot hand theory and the mistakes many  statisticians make assuming that believing in the hot hand is just the same as the gambler&#39;s fallacy of believing that one should bet on a roulette wheel that has shown a streak of results.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Let’s say we have an &lt;i&gt;imperfect casino&lt;/i&gt; with five roulette tables that, if in  perfect condition, select red and black 50 percent of the time. The casino’s roulette tables however are in disrepair, and further, the casino sits above a subway line that occasionally shakes the tables, causing them to vary their percentage of hitting black or red from 40-60 to 60-40 with a mean of 50-50. There is no way to observe the condition of the roulette wheel except to observe the results of wagering on the tables.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;With most visitors not having the time to do a long-term statistical analysis of the tables, is wagering on a table that has hit red or black twice in a row a better strategy than randomly betting on any color on any table? Clearly yes: A table that is hitting red 60 percent of the time will hit red twice in a row 36 percent of the time, while a table hitting 40 percent will only hit two in a row 16 percent of the time. With the tables at some range between 40-60 and 60-40, this two-in-a-row percentage will vary between 16 and 36 percent. More often imperfect tables that hit two in a row will have a higher winning percentage.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If every day you walk in to the casino, wait for a table to hit a color twice in a row, then bet on that table and color, over time you will do better than if you randomly bet on a random table and color.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;A real-life non-statistician watching for a hot hand in a basketball game may well be thinking something like: “He hit two in a row, I think he is shooting better than average today.” The non-statistician has also made a correct observation that at least in the case of basketball, daily shooting percentages vary more than one would expect randomly. In the course of a game there is limited information to measure this variance, so looking for shooting streaks is an imperfect way to find players who have a higher underlying skill that day. The statistician&#39;s job is to operationalize that observation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What statisticians will observe is that in the short term on any given day, if you measure any roulette table in the imperfect casino, the percentage of hitting a color after hitting the same color twice in a row will not be different than after any other sequence (unless a subway train passes underneath). This is the same as observing a basketball player on a given day (or a given hour depending on that shooter&#39;s pattern of consistency). This observation misleads the statistician into believing the hot hand is no different than a casino winning streak in a perfect casino, but the statistician is asking a different question than the non-statistician.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The statistician should be asking how the percentage of streaks varies  from day to day; this will more closely operationalize what the non-statistician is observing and make the statistician wealthier as well.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The world of sports is a world of imperfect casinos. This confounds statisticians.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/1140724607159589265/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=1140724607159589265&amp;isPopup=true' title='3 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/1140724607159589265'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/1140724607159589265'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/10/imperfect-casino-analogy-to-hot-hand.html' title='The &quot;Imperfect Casino&quot; Analogy to Hot Hand Perceptions: A Guest Contribution by Mark Lloyd'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>3</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-4494279607608500457</id><published>2012-10-18T19:14:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-18T19:28:48.195-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Yankees&#39; Scoring Drought in ALCS</title><content type='html'>The Detroit Tigers have now &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=321018106&quot;&gt;completed a sweep&lt;/a&gt; of the New York Yankees in the American League Championship Series to advance to baseball&#39;s World Series. Beyond the fact of the Yankees being swept in a playoff series -- the first time this has happened since 1980 -- an additional noteworthy aspect of the ALCS is New York&#39;s extreme difficulty scoring runs. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As shown in the table below (for which I consulted the Yankees&#39; &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/schedule/_/name/nyy/new-york-yankees&quot;&gt;game-by-game log&lt;/a&gt;), the New Yorkers put zeroes on the scoreboard for 36 of the 39 innings played. (You can click on the graphic to enlarge it.) Another way to look at the situation is that the Yankees scored in only around 8% of the innings of the ALCS.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qyn2psnhp5U/UICmNHPoS8I/AAAAAAAACGU/1P-AbHLtdbo/s1600/yankees+alcs.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;101&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qyn2psnhp5U/UICmNHPoS8I/AAAAAAAACGU/1P-AbHLtdbo/s400/yankees+alcs.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over the past few minutes, as I&#39;ve been writing, the announcers on tonight&#39;s Giants-Cardinals National League Championship Series game have been discussing the Yankees&#39; demise. According to these announcers, New York&#39;s team batting average against Detroit was a woeful .157.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, the Tigers have excellent pitching, led by Justin Verlander. Therefore, the Yankees&#39; poor offense in the ALCS might be understandable to some extent. An interesting comparison (to me at least) would be to look at how the Yankees did against Detroit in the regular season. Listed below are all the Yankee-Tiger regular-season games this season and the number of innings per game in which New York scored.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;April 27 -- 6 of 9 innings&lt;br /&gt;April 28 -- 3 of 9&lt;br /&gt;April 29 -- 4 of 8&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;June 1 -- 4 of 9&lt;br /&gt;June 2 -- 3 of 9&lt;br /&gt;June 3 -- 3 of 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;August 6 -- 1 of 9 &lt;br /&gt;August 7 -- 3 of 9&lt;br /&gt;August 8 -- 6 of 9&lt;br /&gt;August 9 -- 2 of 9&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, in contrast to the ALCS, New York scored fairly readily against Detroit in the regular season. In fact, the Yankees scored in 35 of the 89 total innings (39%) in which they batted against Tiger pitching. Thus, the Yankees did not seem to be at an inherent disadvantage against Detroit pitching in the ALCS. New York just got cold.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/4494279607608500457/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=4494279607608500457&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4494279607608500457'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/4494279607608500457'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/10/yankees-scoring-drought-in-alcs.html' title='Yankees&#39; Scoring Drought in ALCS'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-qyn2psnhp5U/UICmNHPoS8I/AAAAAAAACGU/1P-AbHLtdbo/s72-c/yankees+alcs.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-7221259839938831597</id><published>2012-10-13T20:03:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-12-20T11:52:42.663-08:00</updated><title type='text'>Smith&#39;s INT-Free Streak Persists, But WVU Crushed</title><content type='html'>Here&#39;s a follow-up to my &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/10/west-virginia-qb-geno-smith-brings-long.html&quot;&gt;previous posting&lt;/a&gt; on West Virginia quarterback Geno Smith and his streak of not having his passes intercepted.

Looking at Smith&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/college-football/player/_/id/488025/geno-smith&quot;&gt;player page&lt;/a&gt; at ESPN.com, he has played five games this season, attempting 204 passes and completing 166 of them (81.4%), without being picked off a single time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In Smith&#39;s final game of last season, a 70-33 &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncf/boxscore?gameId=320040228&quot;&gt;spanking of Clemson&lt;/a&gt; in the Orange Bowl, he threw the ball 43 times (completing 32 passes) without an interception. In the game before that, a 30-27 Mountaineer win at South Florida, Smith was picked off twice. Looking at the &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/ncf/playbyplay?gameId=313350058&quot;&gt;play-by-play sheet&lt;/a&gt;, Smith&#39;s final interception came with 9:56 remaining in the fourth quarter, a &quot;pick-six&quot; (interception return for touchdown). Smith rebounded, however, to drive WVU to a touchdown and game-winning field goal. During these two drives, he threw a combined 10 passes, of which 7 were completed. (One West Virginia play was listed as &quot;Team pass incomplete,&quot; which may have involved immediately spiking the ball to stop the clock and set up the final field-goal attempt; I&#39;m not including this in Smith&#39;s statistics.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;All told, since his last interception, he has attempted &lt;b&gt;257&lt;/b&gt; passes (204 this season + 43 in the Orange Bowl + 10 at the end of the South Florida game) and completed &lt;b&gt;205&lt;/b&gt; of them (166 this season + 32 in the Orange Bowl + 7 at the end of the South Florida game). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;http://fs.ncaa.org/Docs/stats/football_records/2012/fbs.pdf&quot;&gt;NCAA record book&lt;/a&gt; for top-tier (Football Bowl Subdivision) programs features this entry:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;MOST CONSECUTIVE PASSES ATTEMPTED WITHOUT AN INTERCEPTION&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;i&gt;379—Russell Wilson, North Carolina St., 2008-09&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thus, if Smith continues to average around 40 pass attempts per game and doesn&#39;t throw any interceptions, he could surpass Wilson in three more games. For Smith&#39;s entire collegiate career, he&#39;s thrown 15 interceptions in 1,151 passing attempts (a little over 1%). If we assume, accordingly, that each future pass he throws has a .99 probability of not being intercepted, then his probability of throwing another 122 attempts without an interception (to tie Wilson) is .99 to the 122nd power. This yields roughly a .30 chance of Smith tying Wilson. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some observers may question the value of &lt;i&gt;attempts&lt;/i&gt; without an interception, as under this metric a quarterback receives credit for throwing a ball away when no receiver is open. I (and others) have tried to pinpoint the NCAA record for consecutive &lt;i&gt;completions&lt;/i&gt; without an interception, without getting final resolution. According to a posting on this West Virginia &lt;a href=&quot;http://mbd.scout.com/mb.aspx?s=159&amp;amp;f=2508&amp;amp;t=9654757&quot;&gt;fan site&lt;/a&gt;, Smith is not too far behind some leading figures on consecutive interception-free completions, namely Wilson at 220 and Andre Woodson (Kentucky, 2004-07) at 223. (The fan page lists Smith with 206 straight interception-free completions, a slight discrepancy with my calculation.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When, if ever, will Smith&#39;s collegiate interception-free streak come to an end? Vote in the poll in the right-hand column. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/6865360944802241725/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=6865360944802241725&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/6865360944802241725'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/6865360944802241725'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/10/west-virginia-qb-geno-smith-brings-long.html' title='West Virginia QB Geno Smith Brings Long Interception-Free Streak to Game at Texas Tech'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-3867541890611543762</id><published>2012-10-04T00:23:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2012-10-04T00:29:21.927-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Koji Uehara&#39;s 25 Straight Retired Batters</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BZ3ynOn_9rU/UG0yGEg9wdI/AAAAAAAACE8/ETqWXX7MVFk/s1600/uehara+a.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; cssfloat: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; mea=&quot;true&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BZ3ynOn_9rU/UG0yGEg9wdI/AAAAAAAACE8/ETqWXX7MVFk/s1600/uehara+a.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;A few nights ago, as the Texas Rangers brought in pitcher Koji Uehara for a late-inning appearance, one of the announcers on the telecast I was watching argued that Uehara was as hot a pitcher as was currently going in Major League Baseball. Naturally, when I hear a claim like that, I have to check it out!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;After a few days had gone by, I examined&amp;nbsp;ESPN.com&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/_/id/30130/koji-uehara&quot;&gt;statistical page&lt;/a&gt; for Uehara. I also searched for recent articles, one of which confirmed that before the streak ended (on October 1), Uehara had &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/blog/dallas/texas-rangers/post/_/id/4892517/rapid-reaction-30&quot;&gt;retired 25 consecutive batters&lt;/a&gt;. To put things in perspective, a perfect game involves retiring 27 straight batters (i.e., 3 batters in each of 9 innings). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In honor of Uehara&#39;s accomplishment, I have listed the 25 batters that&amp;nbsp;he sat down consecutively&amp;nbsp;(along with the type of out each made) to the right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I discuss in my book &lt;em&gt;Hot Hand&lt;/em&gt;, then-Chicago White Sox pitcher Mark Buehrle holds the record for consecutive batters retired, at 45. The leaders in this category include starters (such as Buehrle) and relievers such as Bobby Jenks (41). In my book, I asked whether a streak of consecutive batters retired would be easier for a starter or reliever to achieve, citing the following considerations:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&quot;A starter can... build up the streak in fewer games, but must have the stamina to keep pitching at a high level throughout the game.&lt;span style=&quot;mso-spacerun: yes;&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;A reliever, on the other hand, may know that he is only going to pitch an inning or two on a given night, which would allow him to concentrate on retiring just a few opposing batters (going “all guns a blazing” with each one). A reliever, though, would have to keep this up for perhaps 20, 30, or more appearances to contend for this record&quot; (p. 93).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QSrhYRXc5is/UG0yJj3t0WI/AAAAAAAACFE/769GyAIBV1g/s1600/uehara+b.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; cssfloat: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; mea=&quot;true&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-QSrhYRXc5is/UG0yJj3t0WI/AAAAAAAACFE/769GyAIBV1g/s1600/uehara+b.jpg&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I invite readers to share their views on this matter, in the Comments. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/3867541890611543762/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=3867541890611543762&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3867541890611543762'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/3867541890611543762'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/10/koji-ueharas-25-straight-retired-batters.html' title='Koji Uehara&#39;s 25 Straight Retired Batters'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-BZ3ynOn_9rU/UG0yGEg9wdI/AAAAAAAACE8/ETqWXX7MVFk/s72-c/uehara+a.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-5489716719212695980</id><published>2012-09-29T08:42:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2012-09-29T08:50:46.650-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Baseball Streaks in Regular Season&#39;s Final Days</title><content type='html'>With only five days left (including today) in Major League Baseball&#39;s regular season, a number of hot and cold streaky performances are adding to the excitement down the stretch.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Detroit Tigers&#39; Miguel Cabrera is threatening to become the first &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Major_League_Baseball_Triple_Crown&quot;&gt;Triple Crown&lt;/a&gt; winner in either league since 1967. As of Saturday morning, he leads the American League in batting average (.327, to .322 for his nearest competitor) and runs batted in (133, with his closest rival at 125). Cabrera&#39;s 42 home runs put him one behind the leader, Texas&#39;s Josh Hamilton. However, Toronto&#39;s Edwin Encarnacion also has 42 homers and there are players with 41 and 40. Thus, a homer outburst by any of Cabrera&#39;s rivals could sink his Triple Crown hopes. Here&#39;s a link to ESPN.com&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/statistics&quot;&gt;baseball statistics&lt;/a&gt; page, for monitoring the situation. As can be seen on this page of Cabrera&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/player/splits/_/id/5544/miguel-cabrera&quot;&gt;personal statistics&lt;/a&gt;, he has raised his performance in some categories from before the All-Star break (taken as a rough marker of the season&#39;s halfway point) to after. Before the break, he had 18 homers in 343 at-bats; after the break, he&#39;s hit 24 round-trippers in only 262 AB. His batting average is also somewhat higher post- than pre-All Star break (.332 to .324). However, in the past seven days, he has hit only .226 and homered only once. He had a recent 0-for-8 slump that he &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.mlive.com/tigers/index.ssf/2012/09/triple_crown_watch_miguel_cabr.html&quot;&gt;ended on Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Stay tuned!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Pittsburgh Pirates, whose bid to end their streak of 19 straight seasons with a losing (sub-.500) record we&#39;ve been following, are now 76-81. The best they can do is finish 81-81. It wouldn&#39;t be a winning record, but it would be a &lt;i&gt;non-losing&lt;/i&gt; mark. Honestly, though, it seems highly unlikely the Pirates can win out the rest of the way, so their streak of losing seasons is almost certain to reach 20.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Last night&#39;s opener of a series between the Tampa Bay Rays and the Chicago White Sox featured teams going in the opposite direction. The White Sox had lost &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/schedule/_/name/chw/chicago-white-sox&quot;&gt;8 of their last 9&lt;/a&gt; to fall behind Detroit in the AL Central standings (with virtually no hope for a wild-card path to the playoffs), whereas the Rays had &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/schedule/_/name/tb/tampa-bay-rays&quot;&gt;won 8 straight&lt;/a&gt; to keep their playoff hopes alive. The Sox &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=320928104&quot;&gt;won last night&#39;s game&lt;/a&gt;, however, by a 3-1 score. The win keeps Chicago in contention for the division title, 1 game behind the Tigers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim are keeping the pressure on the Baltimore Orioles and Oakland A&#39;s, the teams currently positioned for the AL&#39;s two wild-card slots. The Angels, having won 25 of their last 35, are only 2 games behind the O&#39;s and A&#39;s in the wild-card standings. The Angels&#39; talent -- free-agent superstar acquisition Albert Pujols, top youngsters &lt;a href=&quot;http://sports.yahoo.com/news/angels-trout-trumbo-emerged-dangerous-074012967--mlb.html&quot;&gt;Mark Trumbo and Mike Trout&lt;/a&gt;, and stellar pitchers Jered Weaver and Zack Greinke (a late-season acquisition) -- make them a team no one wants (potentially) to face in the playoffs.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The Chicago Cubs are ending a dismal season in a dismal way, dropping &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/team/schedule/_/name/chc/chicago-cubs&quot;&gt;10 of their last 11&lt;/a&gt; games. One small measure of glory for the Cubs was the immaculate fielding of second-baseman Darwin Barney, who had a major streak going for consecutive error-free games. However, after tying the record for his position at 141 straight games without an error, he &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/chicago/mlb/story/_/id/8437810/chicago-cubs-2b-darwin-barney-record-errorless-streak-ends-141-games&quot;&gt;made one last night&lt;/a&gt;! </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/5489716719212695980/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=5489716719212695980&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/5489716719212695980'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/5489716719212695980'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/09/baseball-streaks-in-regular-seasons.html' title='Baseball Streaks in Regular Season&#39;s Final Days'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-7968507975320460201</id><published>2012-09-21T17:32:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2012-09-22T16:01:52.875-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Orioles&#39; 15-Game Winning Streak in Extra-Inning Contests</title><content type='html'>With Wednesday&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://scores.espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=320919112&quot;&gt;11-inning victory at Seattle&lt;/a&gt;, the Baltimore Orioles have won their last 15 extra-inning games, the longest such streak since 1949. One might hypothesize that an extra-inning game is like a coin-flip, with each team having close to a 50/50 chance to win.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once a game goes beyond nine innings, it can be decided by as little as one extra frame, where one swing of the bat can be decisive. Perhaps the home team is at a little bit of an advantage, but baseball in general has one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/2712/take-me-out-to-the-ball-game&quot;&gt;smallest home-field advantages&lt;/a&gt; among popular team sports.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If one flipped a coin in series of some defined length (e.g., sets of 10 or 15 flips) and then plotted a histogram of how frequently different breakdowns of heads and tails occurred (e.g., 50% heads/50% tails; 20% heads/80% tails), the most common occurrence in the long run would be 50/50. Other divisions close to 50/50, such as 49/51, 51/49, 48/52, and 52/48 would also be fairly common, though progressively less so the further one moved away from 50/50. As long as the number of tosses in each series was not too small, extreme breakdowns such as 0% heads/100% tails and vice versa would be very rare. This pattern of outcomes yields the familiar &lt;a href=&quot;http://esa21.kennesaw.edu/modules/basics/exercise3/3-6.htm&quot;&gt;&quot;normal&quot; or &quot;bell-shaped&quot; curve&lt;/a&gt;.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To see if the outcomes of extra-inning baseball games are like coin flips, therefore, we can examine teams&#39; winning percentages in extra-inning games and see if the frequencies of different winning percentages resemble the bell-shaped distribution of coin-flips.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Using ESPN.com&#39;s &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/standings/_/type/expanded&quot;&gt;expanded standings&lt;/a&gt;&quot; from 2012 (as of last night), 2011, and 2010, I generated 90 team-year winning percentages in extra-inning games (see column with the heading &quot;XTRA&quot;). In other words, the 2012 Orioles, 2011 Orioles, and 2010 Orioles would be three separate data points, as would the 2012 Yankees, 2011 Yankees, and 2010 Yankees, and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;For the 2012 season to date, Baltimore&#39;s extra-inning record is 15-2 (.882), as shown in the far right-hand side of the following graph (which you can click to enlarge). As the graph shows, .500 is the most common extra-inning record in the past three seasons, which occurred 15 times among the 90 team-specific data points. This result is consistent with extra-inning games being like coin-tosses, as is the general tapering off of the curve in both directions from 50/50. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hydm1umLW1s/UFz1SD7HTeI/AAAAAAAACCM/CiZb7CVYAys/s1600/extra+innings.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;333&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hydm1umLW1s/UFz1SD7HTeI/AAAAAAAACCM/CiZb7CVYAys/s400/extra+innings.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Under a prior assumption of a 50/50 success rate in extra-inning games, the probability of a team (in this case, the Orioles) winning 15 or more out of 17 is about 1 or 2 in 1,000, according to this &lt;a href=&quot;http://vassarstats.net/binomialX.html&quot;&gt;online binomial calculator&lt;/a&gt; from Vassar College. Such an occurrence would thus be rare, but would be expected to happen every several decades.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Keeping in mind that Major League Baseball expanded to 26 teams in 1977, 28 in 1993, and finally 30 in 1998 (history of &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expansion_team&quot;&gt;MLB expansions&lt;/a&gt;), one would have to go back 36 years to compile roughly 1,000 team-years. Interestingly, as noted above, one must go back 63 years, to 1949, to find an extra-inning winning streak at least as long as the 2012 Orioles&#39; 15 games. Back in 1949, the Cleveland Indians won 17 straight. &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;At the low end of the above distribution stands the 2012 Houston (Dis)Astros. The probability of a team winning 1 or fewer out of 12, given the 50/50 assumption, is around 4 in 1,000.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Further supporting the idea of extra-inning games as coin flips is the finding of non-significant skew (tilt to the right or left) and kurtosis (exaggerated peak) in the plot of teams&#39; extra-inning winning percentages.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;UPDATE:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt; On Saturday afternoon, September 22, the Orioles &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/mlb/recap?gameId=320922102&amp;amp;teams=baltimore-orioles-vs-boston-red-sox&quot;&gt;extended their streak&lt;/a&gt; to 16 straight wins in extra-inning games, with a 9-6 win over Boston in 12. </content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/7968507975320460201/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=7968507975320460201&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7968507975320460201'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/7968507975320460201'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/09/orioles-15-game-winning-streak-in-extra.html' title='Orioles&#39; 15-Game Winning Streak in Extra-Inning Contests'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Hydm1umLW1s/UFz1SD7HTeI/AAAAAAAACCM/CiZb7CVYAys/s72-c/extra+innings.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-6704038708258743626</id><published>2012-09-19T10:17:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-09-19T18:23:37.546-07:00</updated><title type='text'>&quot;Hot Hand&quot; Book to Be in Texas Tech Faculty Exhibit</title><content type='html'>&lt;i&gt;Hot Hand&lt;/i&gt;, the book, will be part of the Texas Tech University library&#39;s annual faculty authors exhibit, beginning Wednesday, October 17.

This is the first year that each league will have two wild-card teams, who will face each other in a one-game playoff (within each league) to begin the postseason. Barring a major collapse, the Atlanta Braves should capture a wild-card slot without much problem (although the Braves did &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/09/29/braves-collapse-lose-phillies-miss-wild-card_n_986437.html&quot;&gt;fall apart&lt;/a&gt; in a similar situation a year ago). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As shown in the following table, some of the other wild-card contenders have experienced recent streaks that have either strengthened or weakened their playoff prospects.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot; bordercolor=&quot;#FFCC00&quot; cellpadding=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #ffffcc; width: 100%px;&quot;&gt; &lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Team&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Record&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Recent Streak?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;Atlanta&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;84-63&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;St. Louis&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: center;&quot;&gt;77-70&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;td style=&quot;text-align: left;&quot;&gt;Lost 8 of 10 (Sept. 5-15)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;  &lt;td&gt;L.A.

The Phillies occupied last place in the NL East &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.thereporteronline.com/article/20120813/SPORTS12/120819901/mlb-kratz-does-it-again-for-phils&quot;&gt;until mid-August&lt;/a&gt; and were &quot;sellers&quot; at the trading deadline (i.e., trying to build for the future rather than win now), &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.philly.com/philly/sports/phillies/Reports_Phillies_nearing_deal_with_Dodgers_for_Shane_Victorino.html&quot;&gt;trading away&lt;/a&gt; outfielders Shane Victorino and Hunter Pence. However, any team whose pitching staff includes Roy Halladay, Cliff Lee, and Cole Hamels can win games, and that&#39;s exactly what Philadelphia did. Losing 3 of 4 to lowly Houston this weekend has put a serious dent in the Phillies&#39; playoff hopes, though.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Over in the right-hand column,you can vote in a poll regarding who you think will grab the second NL wild-card slot (assuming Atlanta wins the first one).

For example, if the Chicago Bears&#39; defense thwarts a Green Bay Packers&#39; attempt to go for it on fourth down, does this development spur the Bears&#39; offense to greater immediate success than it would have achieved absent the big defensive play? Presented by Aaron W. Johnson, Alexander J. Stimpson, and Torin K. Clark at last spring&#39;s MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference, the paper is entitled &quot;Turning the Tide: Big Plays and Psychological Momentum in the NFL.&quot; A copy of the paper can be found &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/02/92-Big-Plays-and-Psychological-Momentum-in-the-NFL.pdf&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Johnson and colleagues looked at archival records of nearly one-half million plays from almost 3,000 NFL games between 2000-2010. The way defenses ended their opponents&#39; drives were classified into &quot;big plays&quot; (e.g., fourth-down stops, turnovers due to interception or fumble) or routine stops (forcing the opponent to punt). The authors then asked: Do offenses that take the field as a result of a big play by their defensive teammates do better than offenses who take over after a routine defensive stop? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Three criteria of immediate offensive success were used: number of  yards gained on the first play of the drive, whether the offense gained a  first down (or touchdown) on the drive, and the number of points scored  on the drive. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As I understand the authors&#39; approach, they would find in their vast database, one pair at a time, an offensive drive that began immediately following a big defensive play and another offensive drive that followed a routine defensive stop. The authors made sure, within each contrasting pair, that both drives began from roughly the same yard line, to hold constant field position. Ultimately, a huge number of pairs were analyzed.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What the authors found, contrary to the idea of momentum carryover from defense to offense, is that offensive units that took the field after their defensive teammates had made a big play did not produce significantly more yards, first downs, or points than their counterparts who took the field after a routine stop by their defense. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;One question, I feel, that would be interesting to address in future research is whether a big defensive play leads to a team&#39;s decision to have the offense go for its own big play upon taking possession (e.g., by throwing a long pass or running a double-reverse). Such a play could come to naught, but if the other team&#39;s defense comes onto the field with its heads hanging, the offense could catch the defense off guard.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/902217871604178343/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=902217871604178343&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/902217871604178343'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/902217871604178343'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/09/does-defensive-big-play-in-us-football.html' title='Does a Defensive &quot;Big Play&quot; in U.S. Football Carry Over to the Offense?'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-420424779682093258</id><published>2012-08-28T18:13:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-08-28T18:13:27.463-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Can Pirates End Streak of Sub-.500 Seasons?</title><content type='html'>When last we looked in on the Pittsburgh Pirates, they had gone 17-9 in the &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/08/mlb-teams-in-july-hot-cold-and_1.html&quot;&gt;month of July&lt;/a&gt;, putting them in good position to end their streak of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2011/09/with-yesterdays-loss-to-st.html&quot;&gt;19 straight seasons&lt;/a&gt; with a losing (below .500) record.

(You can click on the graphic to enlarge it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vUi2t2Ph0tw/UD1orCwJlnI/AAAAAAAAB90/yKzx9_m7c2k/s1600/pirates+august+2012.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; src=&quot;http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vUi2t2Ph0tw/UD1orCwJlnI/AAAAAAAAB90/yKzx9_m7c2k/s1600/pirates+august+2012.jpg&quot; height=&quot;252&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Since then, however, the Bucs have won only 5 games, while losing 13. I would say Pittsburgh still has a good chance to finish above .500, but now the team must win a little more than 40% of its remaining games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Working in the Pirates&#39; favor, they have 13 games left against the Cubs (7) and Astros (6), two of the worst teams this year. The floundering New York Mets are also on the schedule for four games.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Will the Pirates finally achieve a winning season? I have created a poll in the right-hand column, so you can let us know what you think.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/420424779682093258/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=420424779682093258&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/420424779682093258'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/420424779682093258'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/08/can-pirates-end-streak-of-sub-500.html' title='Can Pirates End Streak of Sub-.500 Seasons?'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vUi2t2Ph0tw/UD1orCwJlnI/AAAAAAAAB90/yKzx9_m7c2k/s72-c/pirates+august+2012.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-204427235897378269</id><published>2012-08-12T13:20:00.000-07:00</published><updated>2012-08-12T18:23:25.093-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Final Batch of 2012 Olympic Streaks</title><content type='html'>With yesterday&#39;s 86-50 blowout over France, the U.S. women&#39;s basketball team won its &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/basketball/story/_/id/8260119/2012-london-olympics-united-states-women-basketball-team-wins-5th-straight-gold&quot;&gt;fifth straight Olympic gold medal&lt;/a&gt; and 41st straight game in Olympic play.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Jamaican track star Usain Bolt became, in the words of this &lt;a href=&quot;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/1291740-usain-bolt-unprecedented-double-double-leaves-no-doubt-hes-best-sprinter-ever%22&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;the first athlete ever to win the vaunted 100-200 sprint double in consecutive Olympics.&quot;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Finally, when the Bahamas captured the men&#39;s 4 X 400 relay, NBC track and field analyst Ato Boldon pointed out that this was the first time the U.S. men had been &quot;beaten on the track&quot; in this event in Olympic competition since the 1952 Helsinki (Finland) Games. If one looks at an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.databaseolympics.com/sport/sportevent.htm?sp=ATH&amp;amp;enum=230&quot;&gt;all-time results list&lt;/a&gt; for this event, one finds three instances between 1952 and this year of the U.S. not winning the 4 X 400:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1972, Americans Vince Matthews and Wayne Collett, who had finished one-two in the 400-meter dash, were dismissed from the remainder of the Games for &lt;a href=&quot;http://speedendurance.com/2011/02/01/vince-matthews-and-wayne-collette-1972-the-forgotten-protest/#&quot;&gt;alleged disrespectful conduct&lt;/a&gt; during the medal ceremony. This development, along with an injury to John Smith (a one-time world record-holder in the non-metric 440-yard dash), thus incapacitated the U.S. relay foursome.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 1980, there was the U.S. boycott of the Moscow Olympics.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In 2000, the Americans won the race on the track, but &quot;were stripped of their gold ... because of doping infractions&quot; (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/sports/2012/08/10/bahamas-wins-1600-relay-ahead-hobbled-us-team/%20%20&quot;&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;Technically, I would say, Boldon is correct. However, at least in 2000, the U.S. was found to have gotten an unfair performance advantage. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/204427235897378269/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=204427235897378269&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/204427235897378269'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/204427235897378269'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/08/final-batch-of-2012-olympic-streaks.html' title='Final Batch of 2012 Olympic Streaks'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-6865686271063525125</id><published>2012-08-08T20:25:00.002-07:00</published><updated>2012-08-29T12:22:34.643-07:00</updated><title type='text'>More Olympic Streaks</title><content type='html'>U.S. beach volleyball players Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh today concluded their illustrious career, as the duo won the women&#39;s gold medal for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/london/volleyball/story/2012-08-08/London-Olympics-Misty-May-Kerri-Walsh-beach-volleyball-Christine-Brennan/56889954/1?csp=34sports&quot;&gt;third consecutive Olympics&lt;/a&gt;.

Michael Phelps has now accomplished this feat -- twice! Last Thursday, Phelps &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/swimming/story/_/id/8227208/2012-summer-olympics-michael-phelps-outduels-ryan-lochte-take-gold-200-im-20th-medal&quot;&gt;won the 200-meter individual medley&lt;/a&gt;, adding to his 2004 and 2008 titles in the event. Then, last night, Phelps achieved a three-peat in the 100 butterfly, an event in which he&#39;s had some close calls. As noted in this &lt;i&gt;USA Today&lt;/i&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/london/swimming/story/2012-08-03/michael-phelps-usa-gold-medal-100-butterfly/56749986/1&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Phelps finished in 51.21  to [South African Chad] le Clos&#39; 51.44.  That&#39;s a comfortable cushion. Consider this: Phelps won the 100 fly by  four-hundredths of a second in Athens — and by one-hundredth in Beijing.&quot;&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Tonight, the US men won the 400 medley relay (with Phelps swimming the butterfly leg). This makes the American men a &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olympic_medalists_in_swimming_%28men%29#4.C3.97100_metre_medley_relay&quot;&gt;perfect 13-for-13&lt;/a&gt; in the event (excluding 1980, when the US boycotted the Moscow Games).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Zimbabwe&#39;s Kirsty Coventry &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.reuters.com/london-olympics-2012/articles/swimming/womens-200m-backstroke/2012/08/03/franklin-us-wins-womens-200m-backstroke-gold&quot;&gt;fell short&lt;/a&gt; in her bid to win the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Olympic_medalists_in_swimming_%28women%29#200_metre_backstroke&quot;&gt;women&#39;s 200 backstroke&lt;/a&gt; for the third straight Olympics. As I &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/07/great-olympic-streaks-womens-swimming.html&quot;&gt;noted previously&lt;/a&gt;, two female swimmers in history have won the same event three consecutive times, Dawn Fraser (100 freestyle, 1956 through &#39;64) and  Krisztina Egerszegi (200 back, 1988 through &#39;96).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Women&#39;s beach volleyball duo Misty May-Treanor and Kerri Walsh, still undefeated in their quest for a third straight gold medal, lost a game (also known as a set) for the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/08/01/olympic-beach-volleyball-treanor-walsh-lose_n_1730979.html&quot;&gt;first time ever&lt;/a&gt; in Olympic play. Last Wednesday, the US pair dropped the first game 17-21 against Austrian sisters Stefanie and Doris Schwaiger, but rebounded to even the match with a 21-8 rout and then prevailed in the decisive third set, 15-10.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;In easily winning today&#39;s final of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/olympics-2012/serena-williams-blasts-maria-sharapova-court-win-olympic-gold-singles-completes-golden-slam-article-1.1128937&quot;&gt;women&#39;s tennis singles&lt;/a&gt; competition, Serena Williams defeated Russia&#39;s Maria Sharapova for the eighth straight time the two have faced each other (click &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.matchstat.com/Compare/-241/-503/-7240&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; for list of their head-to-head matches).

Pittsburgh&#39;s July play is noteworthy in that it has helped lift the Pirates to a current 60-44 record, as they seek to end a streak of &lt;a href=&quot;http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2011/09/with-yesterdays-loss-to-st.html&quot;&gt;19 consecutive losing&lt;/a&gt; (i.e., sub-.500) seasons. The Pirates must win at least 22 of their final 58 games to ensure a winning record.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;The following chart shows how these four teams fared on each of July&#39;s 31 days (there were actually only 27 days of play, due to the All-Star Break; days without games are indicated with a slash).

One event that I watched today and that potentially is an excellent candidate for hot-hand analysis is archery. As I discuss in my book and in this &lt;a href=&quot;http://blog.petermcgraw.org/2011/03/why-do-bowlers-get-a-hot-hand-but-basketball-players-dont/&quot;&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;, sports that are most conducive to streakiness are those that consist of relatively simple motions that can be repeated with little delay between attempts.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The event I watched today, specifically, was the men&#39;s team archery final, between Italy and the United States. Each team has three shooters or archers. When it&#39;s a team&#39;s turn, each member will get one shot, so that several minutes will elapse between consecutive shots by any one person. This aspect is not optimal for detecting streakiness. Also, each member gets only eight attempts. Thus, even when aggregating over all six participants, the total number of shots is too small for traditional statistical analysis.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Still, for curiosity&#39;s sake, I thought I&#39;d examine the arrow-shooting sequences. Archers receive 10 points for their team by hitting the bullseye, and 9, 8, 7, etc., for landing their arrow in each respective outward ring from the center. As I depict in the following chart, no archer earned below an 8 on any shots. Archery matches (in the team format, at least) are organized into four sets (known as &quot;ends&quot;) of six shots each. Because each archer on a three-person team shoots twice in one end, I designate the shots as &quot;1a&quot; for first shot of the first end, &quot;1b&quot; for second shot of the first end, and so forth.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-16xfggscLNY/UBRo2hTh-QI/AAAAAAAAB6Y/EPBnCcvqnRY/s1600/olympic+archery.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;242&quot; src=&quot;http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-16xfggscLNY/UBRo2hTh-QI/AAAAAAAAB6Y/EPBnCcvqnRY/s400/olympic+archery.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I decided to simplify my little analysis by dividing  outcomes into two categories: 10&#39;s (bullseyes) and non-10&#39;s (i.e., 8 or 9). The &quot;hot hand&quot; concept, in the sense of &quot;success begetting success,&quot; suggests that when an archer shoots a bullseye (10-pointer), he or she should have a higher probability than usual of hitting a bullseye on his or her next shot, as well.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Highlighted in gold in the above chart are all attempts that immediately followed a 10. For example, USA Shooter A earned a 10 on his 3a shot, so his next cell (for 3b) is highlighted in gold. Shot 3b was also a 10, so 4a is gold. Unshaded white cells represent attempts immediately following a non-10. Each shooter&#39;s first attempt (green cells) is excluded from the analysis, because he had no prior attempts at that point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As described above, the hot hand hypothesis predicts that 10&#39;s will be more common (percentagewise) in the gold cells than in the white cells. As shown at the bottom of the chart, this pattern is exactly what was found: Bullseyes occurred on 46% of the arrows fired after the same archer had hit a bullseye on his previous shot. In contrast, bullseyes occurred on only 28% of the arrows fired after the same archer had scored an 8 or 9 on his previous shot.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Given the small sample, the difference between 46% and 28% was not statistically significant, but it was in the direction predicted by hot-hand reasoning. Considering that the archers faced delays of several minutes between their own shots, this result isn&#39;t bad!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I will keep my eye out for additional archery events during these games (men&#39;s individual, women&#39;s team and individual) and I invite readers to do the same. Statistics for all sports are available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.nbcolympics.com/&quot;&gt;NBCOlympics.com&lt;/a&gt;. For the men&#39;s team archery final, all the shot-by-shot data were available online (albeit organized in a different format than I used), so I was able to verify the scores I wrote down while watching the event against what was listed on the website. However, as a precaution, I would urge readers interested in conducting their own analyses to write down as much data as they can while watching events on television.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/645625056523064441/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=645625056523064441&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/645625056523064441'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/645625056523064441'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/07/is-there-hot-hand-in-olympic-archery.html' title='Is There a Hot Hand in Olympic Archery?'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-16xfggscLNY/UBRo2hTh-QI/AAAAAAAAB6Y/EPBnCcvqnRY/s72-c/olympic+archery.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-6166147559143372554</id><published>2012-07-27T12:21:00.003-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-27T13:03:09.122-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Great Olympic Streaks: Basketball</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NXMevAM4z-4/UBKcyeZHXcI/AAAAAAAAB5Y/XiDmErdSilo/s1600/olympic+2012.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-NXMevAM4z-4/UBKcyeZHXcI/AAAAAAAAB5Y/XiDmErdSilo/s200/olympic+2012.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Here is the 10th and final entry of my series on top Summer Olympic streaks and dynasties, leading into tonight&#39;s opening ceremonies of the London Games. To see the earlier entries, covering sports such as gymnastics, swimming, track and field, and volleyball, just keep scrolling down the page.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To my mind, no Olympic streak is more noteworthy -- either for its duration or its ending -- than that of the U.S. men&#39;s basketball program. As indicated below in a chart I created from &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_in_the_Summer_Olympics%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wikipedia data&lt;/a&gt;, the American men entered the 1972 gold-medal game against the Soviet Union with the U.S. having won all seven gold medals ever contested in Olympic history and with a 62-game winning streak (some &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/classic/s/Classic_1972_usa_ussr_gold_medal_hoop.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sources&lt;/a&gt; list it as a 63-game streak, but they may be counting a first-round forfeit win over Spain &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_at_the_1936_Summer_Olympics%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;in 1936&lt;/a&gt;). As the chart also shows, some of the greatest basketball players of all-time, such as Bill Russell, Oscar Robertson, Jerry West, and Bill Bradley played for the U.S. during basketball&#39;s early decades as an Olympic sport. (You may click on the chart to enlarge it.)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZBThhOeTuS4/UBKdCm_5UZI/AAAAAAAAB5k/agakysIKNWA/s1600/olympic+men%27s+basketball.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;292&quot; src=&quot;http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-ZBThhOeTuS4/UBKdCm_5UZI/AAAAAAAAB5k/agakysIKNWA/s400/olympic+men%27s+basketball.jpg&quot; width=&quot;400&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As many readers will recall, the &#39;72 USA-USSR men&#39;s title game is best known for the Soviets, trailing by 1 point with 3 seconds left, receiving three chances to inbound the ball (an original and two do-overs) and finally winning, 51-50. An ESPN Sports Century documentary on the 1972 final is available from YouTube (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6wHxOVZtdqg&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Part 1&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tUNmYsdYFCc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Part 2&lt;/a&gt;). If you&#39;re too young to remember what happened in that game, the YouTube videos are well worth your time.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Some observers have argued from a U.S. perspective that, even being &lt;i&gt;in a position to lose&lt;/i&gt; in a fluke ending by not being well ahead of the Soviet Union reflected poorly on the coaching and preparation of the American team. I would say there&#39;s some truth to that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Of course, in the larger scheme, with the murder of 11 Israeli athletes and coaches during the Munich Olympics (&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munich_massacre&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/abraham-h-foxman/time-to-commemorate-munich_b_1701756.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), the results of a basketball game are trivial. I was just shy of 10 years old during the 1972 Olympics. I must say, though, that seeing the video on the &#39;72 US-Soviet basketball game recently, 40 years after the fact, I still found it jarring. Whatever joy the Soviets got out of the game was probably short-lived also. Alexander Below, who scored the winning basket, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.chron.com/CDA/archives/archive.mpl/1989_652206/ex-soviet-coach-marks-anniversary-of-olympic-win-i.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;died of cancer&lt;/a&gt; just 6 years later.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;(For more pleasant reading on men&#39;s Olympic basketball [and other sports], including the Oscar Roberson and Jerry West led U.S. &quot;dream team&quot; of collegians, I would highly recommend the book &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/Rome-1960-Summer-Olympics-Stirred/dp/B003E7ETKI/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Rome 1960&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt; by David Maraniss, which came out a few years ago.)&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whereas the U.S. men won all the early gold medals in basketball and later began to face stiffer opposition (requiring the infusion of NBA players), the U.S. women faced tough hoops competition from the beginning (1976) and then became more dominant over time. As shown on this Wikipedia page that covers both &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basketball_in_the_Summer_Olympics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;men&#39;s and women&#39;s Olympic hoops&lt;/a&gt;, the Soviet Union (and its 1992 post-break-up conglomeration of republics known as the &quot;Unified Team&quot;) won 3 of the first 5 women&#39;s gold medals, with the U.S. winning the others (1984 and &#39;88). However, the American women have won the last 4 gold medals (1996-2008), with the margin of victory always reaching double-digits in the 4 finals.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Before closing, I wanted to mention briefly several additional Summer Olympic streaks in sports I did not already write about:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alad%C3%A1r_Gerevich&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Aladar Gerevich&lt;/a&gt;, an Hungarian fencer born in 1910, won gold in 6 straight Olympics (&#39;32, &#39;36, &#39;48, &#39;52, &#39;56, &#39;60; with the Games of &#39;40 and &#39;44&amp;nbsp; being cancelled due to World War II).

Today, the sport is gymnastics. We&#39;re looking at athletes who have had &quot;unparalleled&quot; success, pardon the pun.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Athletes used to have greater longevity in the sport, which is now dominated by youth (with some &lt;a href=&quot;http://espn.go.com/olympics/summer/2012/gymnastics/story/_/id/8119319/2012-olympics-jonathan-horton-makes-2nd-us-gymnastics-team&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;exceptions&lt;/a&gt;). Some of the best-known gymnasts of the last generation, such as &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Lou_Retton&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Mary Lou Retton&lt;/a&gt;, only competed in one Olympiad. Hence, records for gold medals in consecutive Olympics are held by athletes from earlier eras. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is hard to match the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.gymn-forum.net/Articles/Misc-PerpetualMotion.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;former Soviet Union&lt;/a&gt; for gymnasts who excelled over long Olympic careers. These include the&lt;a href=&quot;http://ph.sports.yahoo.com/news/100-olympic-tidbits--who-s-the-most-bemedalled-athlete--20120519.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; all-time record-holder&lt;/a&gt; for most Olympic medals in &lt;i&gt;any&lt;/i&gt; sport, &quot;Larisa Latynina, who competed in three Olympic Games (1956 to 1964) and  won a staggering total of 18 medals, half of which were of the gold  variety;&quot; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikolay_Andrianov&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nikolai Andrianov&lt;/a&gt;, master of the floor exercise in his era, winning gold in 1972 and ’76, and silver in ’80.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Other gymnasts who performed at an elite level through two or more Olympiad include:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Japan’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sawao_Kato&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Sawao Kato&lt;/a&gt;, winner of the men’s all-around gold medal in 1968 and ’72, and silver medalist in ‘76.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Romania’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nadia_Com%C4%83neci&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Nadia Comaneci&lt;/a&gt; (3 golds in ’76, 2 in ‘80), best known as the “first female gymnast to be awarded a perfect score of 10 in an Olympic gymnastic event.” In addition, Comaneci is  married to &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Conner&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Bart Conner&lt;/a&gt;, a former U.S. gymnastics great.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/V%C4%9Bra_%C4%8C%C3%A1slavsk%C3%A1&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Vera Caslavska&lt;/a&gt; (Czech Republic), “one of only two female gymnasts, along with Soviet Larisa Latynina, to win the all-around  gold medal at two consecutive Olympics.”&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;In addition to the athletes&#39; Wikipedia pages (linked to each person&#39;s name), a very helpful source is this &lt;a href=&quot;http://techblogbiz.blogspot.com/2006/09/top-10-gymnasts-of-all-time.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;all-time list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;i&gt;In tomorrow&#39;s final entry of the series, we&#39;ll look at what I consider the most impressive Olympic streak, one that came to a most controversial end (hint, hint). &lt;/i&gt;</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/2237497223725668721/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=2237497223725668721&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2237497223725668721'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/2237497223725668721'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/07/great-olympic-streaks-gymnastics.html' title='Great Olympic Streaks: Gymnastics'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GMEyMftXThw/UBFcN-RGyGI/AAAAAAAAB5M/wwI6YT7gfPE/s72-c/olympic+2012.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-28819545.post-8226386322751246414</id><published>2012-07-25T17:45:00.001-07:00</published><updated>2012-07-25T17:56:05.328-07:00</updated><title type='text'>Great Olympic Streaks: Women&#39;s Swimming</title><content type='html'>&lt;div class=&quot;separator&quot; style=&quot;clear: both; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RmSwKLmi8FQ/UBCJ0GJxSZI/AAAAAAAAB5A/G_fvWzPYiIc/s1600/olympic+2012.jpg&quot; imageanchor=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; height=&quot;138&quot; src=&quot;http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RmSwKLmi8FQ/UBCJ0GJxSZI/AAAAAAAAB5A/G_fvWzPYiIc/s200/olympic+2012.jpg&quot; width=&quot;200&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Today&#39;s entry on great Summer Olympic streaks, the eighth of a 10-part series leading into Friday&#39;s opening ceremonies, focuses on women&#39;s swimming. One could argue that, whereas men&#39;s Olympic swimming historically has made headlines for athletes capturing large numbers of gold medals within a single Olympiad (e.g., Michael Phelps&#39;s 8 golds in 2008, Mark Spitz&#39;s 7 golds in 1972), the women&#39;s side may be characterized more by athletes&#39; longevity.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;That&#39;s not to say women&#39;s swimming is completely devoid of spectacular single-Games performances. In the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swimming_at_the_1988_Summer_Olympics&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;1988 Seoul Olympics&lt;/a&gt;, East Germany&#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristin_Otto&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Kristin Otto&lt;/a&gt; &quot;won six gold medals, as well as setting world records in the 50&amp;nbsp;m  freestyle, 100&amp;nbsp;m freestyle, 100&amp;nbsp;m backstroke and 100&amp;nbsp;m butterfly&quot; (the other two golds came in the 4 x 100 freestyle and medley relays). &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Several other women&#39;s swimmers exemplify longevity, however. Most visible to American fans would be &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dara_Torres%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dara Torres&lt;/a&gt;, whose Wikipedia page describes her as “the first and only swimmer from the United States to compete in five  Olympic Games (1984, 1988, 1992, 2000 and 2008) … [and who] won at least one medal in  each of the five Olympics in which she [...] competed.” Torres tried to make the U.S. team yet again this year, at the age of 45, but failed to qualify at the Olympic Trials.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Australia’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dawn_Fraser&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Dawn Fraser&lt;/a&gt; claimed 3 straight golds in the 100-meter freestyle (1956, &#39;60, and &#39;64), making her “one of only two swimmers to win the same Olympic event three times.” The other is Hungary’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krisztina_Egerszegi%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Krisztina Egerszegi&lt;/a&gt;, whose 3 straight golds occurred in the 200 backstroke (1988, &#39;92, and &#39;96).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Kirsty Coventry of Zimbabwe will be &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/olympics/swimming/9207204/London-2012-Olympics-golden-girl-Kirsty-Coventry-is-ready-to-shine-at-the-Games-again.html%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;seeking to match&lt;/a&gt; Fraser&#39;s and Egerszegi&#39;s three-peat feat in London, going for her third straight gold in the 200 backstroke, having already won it in 2004 and &#39;08.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natalie_Coughlin%20&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Natalie Coughlin&lt;/a&gt;, the 100-backstroke gold medalist in ’04 and ’08, sought to try for three straight, but didn’t qualify in that event at this year’s U.S. Trials.</content><link rel='replies' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/feeds/8226386322751246414/comments/default' title='Post Comments'/><link rel='replies' type='text/html' href='http://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=28819545&amp;postID=8226386322751246414&amp;isPopup=true' title='0 Comments'/><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8226386322751246414'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/28819545/posts/default/8226386322751246414'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://thehothand.blogspot.com/2012/07/great-olympic-streaks-womens-swimming.html' title='Great Olympic Streaks: Women&#39;s Swimming'/><author><name>alan</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/08047057328265529252</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-RmSwKLmi8FQ/UBCJ0GJxSZI/AAAAAAAAB5A/G_fvWzPYiIc/s72-c/olympic+2012.jpg" height="72" width="72"/><thr:total>0</thr:total></entry></feed>
